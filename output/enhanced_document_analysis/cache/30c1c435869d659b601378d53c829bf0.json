  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document describes standalone pension life cover scheme rules that operate independently and are not contingent on purchasing other financial services. 2) The scheme is specifically designed as an occupational pension scheme with the sole purpose of providing death benefits, as clearly stated in Section 3.4: 'The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 3) There is no language in the document suggesting that purchase of this pension life cover scheme is contingent on buying other financial services from AIB life or connected parties. 4) The document outlines a complete, standalone product governed by pension legislation and Revenue requirements rather than a bundled or contingent financial service. The rules describe a discrete pension product that can be purchased independently of other financial services.",
