  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that provides death benefits only - it is not an investment product as defined in the regulation. The scheme rules explicitly state 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) There are no investment decisions or transactions being made by the consumer - it is a pure protection product with fixed premiums paid by the employer. 3) The document does not involve any assessment of investment suitability or consumer's attitude to risk regarding investments. The benefits are predetermined lump sums and/or pensions for dependants in the event of death. 4) The scheme rules make clear this is an employer-sponsored death benefit arrangement, not a consumer investment product subject to suitability assessments under CPC regulations.",

(1) For the purposes of Regulation 17, when assessing the suitability of an investment product transaction or series of investment product transactions, should a regulated entity determine that the investment product transaction or series is not aligned with a consumer's attitude to risk, or financial situation, because of the frequency of such transactions or their amount, it shall determine that the investment product transaction or series is not suitable. (2) A regulated entity shall advise a consumer of the determination referred to in paragraph (1) on paper or on another durable medium and shall advise the consumer not to proceed with the relevant investment product transaction or series. (3) If a regulated entity has advised the consumer as referred to in paragraph (2), and the consumer instructs the regulated entity to proceed with the relevant transaction or series, the regulated entity shall make a contemporaneous record that it has advised the consumer of its determination.
