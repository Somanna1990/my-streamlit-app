  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of pension scheme rules that outline the structure, benefits, and administration of a pension life cover scheme. It does not contain any content about digital platforms or preselected options for consumer interactions. 2) While the document mentions that customers can use the AIB Mobile Banking app to view documents and update details (Section 6), it does not describe any process requiring consumers to confirm they have read or understood information through preselected options. 3) The document is purely informational and administrative in nature, defining the legal framework of the pension scheme rather than describing consumer interaction processes. The regulation specifically addresses digital platform interactions and preselected confirmations, which are not present in this scheme rules document.",
