  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically concerns investment products and facilities for intermediaries to obtain information about those products. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines death benefits - it is not an investment product. 2) The document describes a pure protection product (life cover) rather than an investment product, as evidenced by statements like 'The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 3) While the document mentions trustees and employers, it does not discuss intermediary relationships or information facilities that would fall under Regulation 404. 4) The product described is a group life assurance scheme structured as an occupational pension scheme, which is fundamentally different from an investment product that would be subject to this regulation.",
