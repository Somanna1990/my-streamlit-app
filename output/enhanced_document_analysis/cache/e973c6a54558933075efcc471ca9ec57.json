  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically deals with setting renewal prices where multiple insurance undertakings/intermediaries are involved. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure and operation of an occupational pension scheme, not a general insurance product with renewal pricing. 2) The document shows this is a single-provider product offered by AIB Life, not a multi-provider insurance arrangement. 3) The scheme rules document focuses on death benefits and trustee responsibilities, with no mention of renewal pricing mechanisms or multiple insurance providers being involved in price setting. 4) The document explicitly states it is regulated under the Pensions Act 1990 and Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, not general insurance regulations. The pricing and premium aspects mentioned in the document (Section 2.3) are fixed amounts determined solely by AIB Life, not involving multiple insurance undertakings.",
