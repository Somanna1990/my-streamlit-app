  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is specifically about an Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme, which is a standalone pension product rather than a bundled product offering. 2) The document makes no mention of product bundling or procedures for switching/exiting bundles. 3) The scheme rules are focused solely on defining the terms, benefits, and administration of a single pension life cover product. 4) While the document is from a regulated entity (AIB life), the specific regulation in question (regarding bundled products) is not relevant to this type of standalone pension scheme document. The document's content deals with pension scheme rules, trustee duties, and death benefits rather than consumer rights regarding bundled financial products.",
