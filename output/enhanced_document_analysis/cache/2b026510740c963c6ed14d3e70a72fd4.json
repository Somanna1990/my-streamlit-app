  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document, not an advertisement. It is a legal/contractual document that outlines the rules, definitions, and operations of a pension life cover scheme. 2) The regulation specifically pertains to warning statements in advertisements for financial services, while this document serves as the foundational rules document for scheme trustees and members. 3) While the document does contain some informational sections and contact details, it is not promotional or advertising material that would fall under the scope of Regulation 82's requirements for warning statements in advertisements. 4) The document's purpose is to establish and govern the operation of a pension scheme, not to promote or advertise financial services to consumers. The content is purely instructional and regulatory in nature.",
