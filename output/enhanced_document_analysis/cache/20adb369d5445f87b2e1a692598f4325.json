  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pure protection life cover scheme that pays out only on death before retirement age - it is not an investment product as defined in the regulation. The scheme rules explicitly state 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) There are no investment elements, units, balances, or investment values to report on as required by regulation 379. The product is a simple death benefit scheme with fixed premiums unless changed. 3) The scheme does not accumulate value or have withdrawals/additions like an investment product would - it simply pays out a defined death benefit if the member dies while the policy is in force. 4) The document makes no mention of investment components or requirements for periodic investment statements. Therefore, since this is a pure protection product rather than an investment product, the requirements for investment product statements under regulation 379 do not apply.",
