  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is specifically about an Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme, which is a death benefit scheme providing benefits to dependants if the member dies before retirement age. This is fundamentally different from permanent health insurance (PHI) which provides disability benefits. 2) The document makes no mention of disability benefits or disability payments - it only covers death benefits. 3) The scheme described is structured as an occupational pension scheme under the Pensions Act and TCA, not as a permanent health insurance policy. 4) The benefits described are lump sum death benefits and dependants' pensions, not disability income. The regulation specifically applies to permanent health insurance policies of class 4/IV, which this product clearly is not. The document is unambiguously about a different type of insurance product (life cover) with different purposes and benefits than those covered by this regulation.",
