  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, definitions, and operation of a pension scheme. It does not contain any provisions or rules about making telephone calls to consumers. 2) While Section 6 'Contacting Us' mentions phone contact details, it is providing customer service information rather than outlining procedures for initiating calls to consumers. 3) The document is focused on establishing the legal and operational framework of a pension scheme between an employer, trustee, and member - it does not address regulated entity communication protocols. 4) The regulation specifically pertains to the manner and frequency of initiating telephone calls to consumers, which is not within the scope or purpose of this scheme rules document. The document's content is purely focused on pension scheme governance and administration.",
