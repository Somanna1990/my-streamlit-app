  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the pension life cover scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document describes a death benefit-only pension scheme that provides lump sum and/or pension benefits to dependants upon death of the member - it does not involve any investment advice services. 2) The scheme is administered by trustees and AIB Life as the registered administrator, but their roles are focused on scheme administration and benefit payments rather than providing investment advice. 3) There is no mention in the document of any investment advisory services being provided, whether independent or non-independent. 4) The document focuses solely on the rules, administration and operation of a death benefit pension scheme rather than investment advice services that would fall under this particular consumer protection regulation regarding independent/non-independent advice.",
