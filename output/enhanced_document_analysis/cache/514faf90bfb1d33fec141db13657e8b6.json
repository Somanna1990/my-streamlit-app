  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document, not an insurance quotation. While it describes an insurance-based product, it is specifically the scheme rules that govern how the pension life cover works. 2) The regulation specifically pertains to information that must be included in insurance quotations provided to consumers. This document is a comprehensive scheme rules document that outlines the operation, benefits, and administration of a company pension life cover scheme, not a quotation document. 3) The document appears to be business-to-business in nature (between an employer and AIB life) rather than a consumer-facing quotation document. The scheme is established by an employer for their employees, making it an occupational pension scheme rather than a direct-to-consumer insurance product. 4) While the document does contain various terms and conditions, these are not warranties or endorsements that would need to be highlighted in a quotation as per the regulation.",
