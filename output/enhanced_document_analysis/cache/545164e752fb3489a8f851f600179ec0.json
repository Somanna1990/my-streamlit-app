  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension life cover scheme rules document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pure protection product (death benefit) rather than an investment product - the scheme's sole purpose is to provide benefits to dependants if the member dies before retirement age, with no investment or capital return component. 2) There is no advertised return of capital mentioned anywhere in the document - the benefits are purely insurance-based lump sum and/or pension payments triggered by death. 3) The document is a scheme rules document rather than an advertisement, so advertising regulations would not apply. 4) The document explicitly states 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' This clearly indicates this is not an investment product with capital returns that would fall under this regulation.",
