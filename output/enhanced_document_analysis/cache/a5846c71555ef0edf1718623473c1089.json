  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of pension scheme rules that outline the structure, benefits, and administration of a pension life cover scheme - it is not itself a digital platform or interface. 2) While Section 6 mentions that customers can use the AIB Mobile Banking app to view documents and update details, these scheme rules are not providing guidance on how to use that digital platform - they are merely referencing its existence. 3) The actual guidance for using the digital platform would need to be provided within the AIB Mobile Banking app itself, not in these scheme rules documentation. 4) The document's primary purpose is to establish and govern a pension scheme, not to provide digital platform navigation instructions. The regulation in question specifically applies to guidance that must be provided within digital platforms themselves, not to scheme rules or policy documents that may be accessed through such platforms.",
