  "applicability": "Applies",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the pension scheme document for several reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page). 2) The document outlines a financial product (Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme) that directly affects consumers. 3) The document includes governance arrangements and procedures that would need to comply with error handling requirements, particularly in sections like 4.1 where AIB life is appointed as registered administrator and section 4.5 which outlines trustee powers for administration. The scheme involves complex financial transactions and benefit calculations that could be subject to errors affecting consumers, making robust error handling procedures essential. The regulation's requirements for error identification, escalation, correction processes, and regular analysis would be directly applicable to the administration of this pension scheme, especially given the potential impact errors could have on beneficiaries' financial outcomes.",
