  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines how benefits are provided through assurances issued by AIB life. As a financial product document, it falls under the scope of the Consumer Protection Regulations. The document partially addresses the requirements of Regulation 21 by stating the main purpose of the scheme and how benefits are provided, but it lacks explicit statements about how fees, commissions, or other remuneration are handled to ensure they don't impair compliance with the regulated entity's duties to act in the consumer's best interests.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The benefits payable under the scheme will be provided by means of an assurance or assurances, to be issued by AIB life.; The employer will pay all premiums under any policy effected under the rules. The initial premium payable is shown on the policy schedule. The premium is a fixed amount unless an indexation or annual increase option applies to the policy, or if changes are made to the policy.; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member.; No decision of the trustee will be invalidated by reason of the trustee having a direct or personal interest in the result of any such decision or in the exercising of any such power provider that such trustee had disclosed any such interest to the other trustees (if any) and to the employer.",
  "gap_description": "The document does not explicitly address how any fees, commissions, or remuneration related to the scheme are handled to ensure they don't impair the regulated entity's duty to act in the consumer's best interests. There is no clear statement about how potential conflicts of interest are managed, how suitability requirements are met, or whether any non-monetary benefits are designed to enhance service quality to the consumer.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Add a specific section addressing how fees, commissions, and remuneration are structured to ensure they don't impair the duty to act in the consumer's best interests.\n2. Include explicit statements about conflict of interest management related to any fees or commissions.\n3. Add language confirming that any non-monetary benefits are designed to enhance service quality.\n4. Include references to suitability assessment processes and how they are not compromised by any remuneration arrangements.\n5. Consider adding a disclosure section that transparently outlines all fees and commissions that might be received by any parties involved in the scheme.",
