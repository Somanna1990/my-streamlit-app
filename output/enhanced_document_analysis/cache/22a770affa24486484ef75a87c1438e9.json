  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is not a prospectus - it is explicitly titled as 'Scheme Rules' for a pension life cover product and functions as a governing document that sets out the terms and conditions of the pension scheme. 2) The document's purpose is to define the rules, benefits, and operational framework of an occupational pension scheme, not to market or sell the product to consumers. 3) The document is primarily focused on defining legal and administrative aspects of the scheme including trustee duties, scheme benefits, and winding up procedures, rather than serving as a marketing or sales document. 4) The document appears to be part of a welcome pack for those already enrolled in the scheme (referenced in definitions section) rather than a prospectus used to solicit new business. While the document does contain contractual terms, it is not presented as a prospectus and therefore falls outside the scope of this specific regulation which only applies to prospectuses.",
