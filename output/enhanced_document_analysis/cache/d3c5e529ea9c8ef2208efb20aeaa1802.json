  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of an executive pension life cover scheme, not a consumer contract. 2) The scheme is specifically for company pensions between employers and employees/directors, not consumer products. This is evidenced by Section 2.2 which states 'An employee or director of the employer shall be eligible for inclusion in the scheme at the employer's discretion.' 3) The document is governed by different legislation, specifically the Pensions Act 1990 and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as mentioned throughout the document. 4) While the document does include contact information in Section 6, this is general contact information rather than consumer dispute resolution information, because this is not a consumer product. 5) The scheme is an occupational pension scheme established by employers for their employees, which falls outside the scope of consumer protection regulations as it is a B2B arrangement.",
