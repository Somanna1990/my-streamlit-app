  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines how the scheme works, definitions, and benefits. As a financial service product document from a regulated entity (AIB Life), it falls under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 regulations. The document partially complies with Regulation 5 on securing customers' interests by clearly defining terms, explaining how the scheme works, and outlining benefits. However, it lacks explicit provisions addressing several requirements of Regulation 5, particularly regarding complaint resolution, error handling, and distinguishing between regulated and unregulated activities.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age. Except as otherwise provided in the rules, benefits cannot be assigned.\nThe benefits payable under the scheme will be provided by means of an assurance or assurances, to be issued by AIB life.\n\nThe policy will pay out a lump sum to the trustee if the member dies while in service of the employer, provided the policy is in force at the time of death and a valid claim is made.; The trustee shall have the power to deduct from the proceeds of any policy any taxes or other deductions for which they are legally responsible. The trustee will not provide any benefit under the scheme that would go over the maximum benefit allowed, or conflict with requirements of the Revenue Commissioners. The trustee will reduce any benefit to ensure it does not exceed the maximum approvable benefits permitted and does not conflict with the Revenue requirements.; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member.; In the interest of customer service we will record and monitor calls.",
  "gap_description": "The document does not address several key requirements of Regulation 5, including: (1) No information on complaint handling processes (Regulation 5(e)); (2) No procedures for resolving errors and mistakes (Regulation 5(f) and (g)); (3) No clear distinction between regulated and unregulated activities (Regulation 5(h)); (4) Limited explicit focus on delivering fair outcomes for customers (Regulation 5(i)).",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Add a dedicated section on complaint handling procedures that explains how complaints will be resolved efficiently, fairly, and in a timely manner.\n2. Include provisions for error resolution, including how errors affecting multiple customers will be handled.\n3. Clearly distinguish between regulated and unregulated activities within the document.\n4. Add explicit statements about the commitment to fair customer outcomes and how the product design takes customer interests into account.\n5. Consider adding a section on how customer interests are secured in the administration of the scheme.",
