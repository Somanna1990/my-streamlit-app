  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that falls under financial services regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. The document defines terms like 'consumer' and 'customer' which are relevant to the regulation. However, while the document provides definitions and explains the scheme's operation, it doesn't fully address all aspects of the regulation's definition requirements, particularly around consumer protection and financial abuse prevention.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The document contains definitions including: \"Dependant Means the member's spouse, civil partner, child under the age of 18 or under the age of 25 and still receiving full-time education or vocational training, or any other person who depends financially on the member as determined by the trustee.\" and \"Member (also known as the life covered in the Policy Schedule) Means an employee of the employer who is eligible for membership and is included in the scheme. For this purpose, employee is a member of staff or director of the employer to whom the letter of exchange is addressed.\"; The scheme is a retirement benefits scheme as defined by Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA, capable of being approved by the Revenue Commissioners as an exempt approved scheme. The scheme may be established by way of a retirement benefits product as defined by Section 772A of the TCA unless premiums exceed the percentage of remuneration limits set out in the TCA, in which circumstances individual approval will be required and obtained from Revenue when the scheme is established.; The TCA specifies that a pension or an amount transferred into an ARF, should not exceed the maximum total benefits that could have been provided for the member assuming the deceased had continued service up to normal retirement age.; Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Registered in Ireland number 701277, VAT number 3804332MH.",
  "gap_description": "The document lacks explicit definitions that align with the Central Bank's regulatory definitions of 'consumer' and 'customer' as specified in Regulation 3. It also does not address the concept of 'financial abuse' which is a key definition in the regulation. Additionally, there is no clear indication that the document acknowledges its status as a regulated entity providing regulated activities.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Add explicit definitions that align with the Central Bank's regulatory definitions of 'consumer' and 'customer' as specified in Regulation 3. 2. Include a definition of 'financial abuse' and provisions to prevent it. 3. Clearly acknowledge the scheme's status as a regulated entity providing regulated activities under Central Bank supervision. 4. Add a section on consumer protection that addresses the standards for business required by the regulation.",
