  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (347) specifically applies to health insurance contracts and notifications regarding lapse of health insurance coverage. The document in question is about an Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme, which is a type of occupational pension scheme providing death benefits for company employees. The document clearly states it is governed by the Pensions Act 1990 and is a retirement benefits scheme as defined by Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA. Additionally, regulation 347(2) explicitly states that it does not apply to corporate insurance schemes arranged by employers for groups of employees, which this document represents. The document details a company pension life cover scheme that is established by an employer for the benefit of employees, making it fall outside the scope of this health insurance-focused regulation.",
