The document provided is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the terms and conditions of a pension scheme. There is no indication in the document that information is provided to consumers through systems to which access might be withdrawn, nor does the document address notification procedures for such withdrawals. The document is focused on defining the scheme rules, benefits, and trustee duties rather than addressing digital access or electronic information delivery systems.",
