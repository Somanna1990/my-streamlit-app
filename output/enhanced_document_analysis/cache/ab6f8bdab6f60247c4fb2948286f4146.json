It contains some elements required by Regulation 115 on record-keeping, such as definitions of terms, information about the financial service provided, and details about the scheme. However, it lacks explicit provisions for maintaining comprehensive records of all the specific items listed in Regulation 115, particularly regarding consumer instructions, complaints, and consent records.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The document contains definitions and information about the scheme: \"The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.\" It also defines key terms like \"Member\", \"Employer\", \"Dependant\", and outlines how the scheme works: \"The policy will pay out a lump sum to the trustee if the member dies while in service of the employer, provided the policy is in force at the time of death and a valid claim is made.\"; The trustee shall have the power to deduct from the proceeds of any policy any taxes or other deductions for which they are legally responsible. The trustee will not provide any benefit under the scheme that would go over the maximum benefit allowed, or conflict with requirements of the Revenue Commissioners. The trustee will reduce any benefit to ensure it does not exceed the maximum approvable benefits permitted and does not conflict with the Revenue requirements. The trustee must comply with any undertaking given to the Revenue Commissioners.; 4.1 The Trustee as Administrator\nThe employer hereby declares itself as trustee of the scheme and administrator of  the scheme for the purposes of the TCA, unless the employer appoints as trustee(s) and  administrator(s) an organisation or individual(s) named as trustee(s) on the letter of exchange or supplementary letter of exchange. The trustee confirms that it will hold the benefits of the scheme under irrevocable trusts in accordance with the terms of the letter of exchange and the rules. \nThe trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member. Annual trustee reports and audited accounts are not required for schemes where the only benefit under the scheme is a death benefit in the event that the member dies before normal retirement age.; Within 12 weeks after a decision to wind up the pension scheme has been made or the date on which the trustee first becomes aware or ought reasonably to have been aware that an event has occurred which requires the scheme to be wound up, notification must be sent to the member (or other persons entitled to receive benefits under the scheme) and the Pensions Authority that a decision has been made, or an event has occurred, to wind up the scheme.",
  "gap_description": "The document does not explicitly address how the regulated entity will maintain records of: (1) consumer instructions and conditions attached to instructions, (2) consumer consent in the required form, (3) comprehensive records of complaints, (4) copies of all correspondence with consumers, (5) copies of all original documents submitted by consumers, and (6) other record-keeping requirements specified in Regulation 115.",
  "gap_recommendations": "The document should be updated to include a specific section on record-keeping that addresses all the requirements of Regulation 115. This should detail how AIB Life will maintain records of consumer instructions, consent, complaints, correspondence, and all other required documentation. The section should specify retention periods and formats for these records, and clarify how consumers can access their information when needed.",
