  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation clearly applies to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (as noted at the end of the document). 2) The document represents rules for a pension life cover scheme, which is a consumer financial product/service. 3) The document contains details of consumer transactions and financial services that would fall under the record retention requirements specified in Regulation 117. Specifically, the document outlines scheme benefits, trustee duties, and payment conditions that constitute consumer transactions and financial services that must be retained for 6 years after completion or discontinuation. The document also contains definitions and rules that would qualify as records provided to consumers that must be retained for 6 years after ceasing to provide services. As a regulated entity providing financial services to consumers, AIB life must comply with these record retention requirements for all documentation related to this pension scheme.",
