  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation in question (Regulation 105 on Procedures for managing and resolving complaints) does not apply to this document because the document is a set of pension scheme rules that outline the structure, definitions, and operation of an Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme. The document does not contain or purport to contain a complaints procedure. The document is establishing the rules of a pension scheme rather than setting out operational procedures for a regulated entity's customer interactions. The document defines terms, explains how the scheme works, and outlines benefits and trustee duties, but does not address consumer-facing operational procedures such as complaint handling.",
