  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operational framework, definitions, and governance of a pension scheme - it is not an insurance quotation document. 2) While the document mentions AIB Life as the life office providing assurance, this document's purpose is to establish the rules and structure of the pension scheme rather than provide quotations. 3) The document does not contain any of the specific quotation elements required by Regulation 328 (monetary amounts, validity periods, or underwriter details in the context of a quote). 4) This is a foundational governance document that establishes the scheme's rules, benefits, trustee duties, and winding up procedures - it serves a different regulatory and operational purpose than insurance quotations. The regulation in question specifically pertains to insurance quotations and renewal notifications, which is not the nature or purpose of this document.",
