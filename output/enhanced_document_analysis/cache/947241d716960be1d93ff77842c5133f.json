  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a scheme rules document that outlines the terms, conditions, and operational details of a pension life cover scheme - it is not an advertisement. 2) The document is a legal/contractual document meant to govern the operation of the pension scheme rather than promote or advertise financial services to consumers. 3) While the document contains definitions, rules, and important information, it serves as reference documentation rather than promotional material. The regulation specifically addresses requirements for advertisements of financial services, including how benefits and risks must be presented in advertising materials. Since this document is not advertising material but rather a comprehensive rulebook for scheme operation, the advertising-specific requirements in Regulation 80 are not applicable. The document appears to be subject to different regulatory requirements related to pension scheme documentation and disclosure, but not advertising regulations.",
