  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure and operation of a pension death benefit scheme, not claims handling procedures. 2) While AIB life is mentioned as the life office provider, this document specifically deals with scheme rules, trustee duties, and benefit structures rather than operational claims procedures. 3) The contact information provided in Section 6 is for general scheme administration, not claims handling. 4) The regulation specifically pertains to insurance undertakings' availability for claims discussions, while this document is focused on establishing the legal framework and rules of a pension scheme. The claims process and insurance undertaking's availability would be covered in separate operational documents or policy conditions, not in these scheme rules. 5) The document explicitly states 'The policy will be subject to the terms and conditions provided to the trustees by the life office' indicating that claims procedures would be detailed in separate policy documentation.",
