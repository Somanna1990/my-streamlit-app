  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation applies to this document as it is written information provided to consumers by a regulated entity (AIB Life). The document appears to use a consistent font size throughout the excerpted content, which suggests some level of compliance. However, without seeing the actual document with its formatting and font sizes, it's impossible to definitively assess if the font size is 'clearly legible and appropriate' as required by the regulation. The document is a pension scheme rules document which contains important legal and financial information that consumers need to understand, making appropriate font size particularly important.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The document appears to be structured with section headings in larger text (e.g., 'SECTION 1 DEFINITIONS', 'SECTION 2 HOW DOES THE SCHEME WORK?') and body text in a consistent format throughout, suggesting some attention to legibility.; The document uses consistent formatting with clear section numbering (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) and uses bullet points for lists (e.g., '– four times the final remuneration of the member; or', '– €6,350;', '•\tFor the benefit of any one or more of the member's spouse, civil partner, children or dependants...').

  "gap_description": "Without seeing the actual document with its formatting, it's impossible to assess if the font size used is 'clearly legible' and 'appropriate to the type of document and the information contained therein' as required by the regulation. Particular concerns would be around the legibility of important definitions and terms that affect consumer rights and benefits.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Review the actual document to ensure font sizes meet minimum legibility standards (typically at least 10-12pt for body text and larger for headings).\n2. Consider using larger font sizes for critical information such as benefit limitations, definitions of key terms, and consumer rights.\n3. Ensure adequate contrast between text and background.\n4. Test the document with a diverse group of consumers, including older adults and those with visual impairments, to ensure legibility.\n5. Consider providing alternative formats (large print versions) for consumers who may need them.",
