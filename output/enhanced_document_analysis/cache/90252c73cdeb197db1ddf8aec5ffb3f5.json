  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that provides death benefits only - it is not an insurance policy that can be automatically renewed. The scheme rules explicitly state it is 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age' and terminates either on death or at normal retirement age. 2) The scheme is established as a one-time setup through a letter of exchange and policy, not as a renewable insurance contract. 3) The document contains no provisions for policy renewal or automatic renewal processes, as this type of pension scheme by its nature continues until termination/wind-up events specified in Section 5 of the rules. 4) The regulation specifically applies to insurance policies with durations of 10 months or more that have automatic renewal features, while this document describes a continuous pension scheme structure that remains in force until specific termination events occur. Therefore, the automatic renewal notification requirements in Regulation 325 are not applicable to this type of pension scheme product.",
