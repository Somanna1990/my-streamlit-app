  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of a pension scheme - it is not a complaints handling procedure or policy. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the provider and is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (as noted at the end of the document), this specific document's purpose is to define the rules and operation of the pension scheme rather than establish operational procedures for complaint handling. 3) The document makes no mention of complaint handling processes or procedures, which would be required if it was meant to comply with this specific regulation. 4) The regulation in question (106) specifically deals with maintaining logs of consumer complaints, which is an operational requirement rather than something that would be included in scheme rules documentation. The scheme rules document serves a different regulatory purpose related to pension scheme governance and structure.",
