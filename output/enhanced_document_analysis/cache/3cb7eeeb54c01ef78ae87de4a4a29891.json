  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the pension life cover scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The regulation specifically addresses situations where a consumer policyholder is not the beneficiary of a settlement. In this document, the scheme is an occupational pension scheme where the employer is the policyholder (not a consumer) and the trustee manages the policy on behalf of the member's dependants. 2) The document outlines a group life insurance scheme established by an employer for employees, which falls under occupational pension regulations rather than consumer protection regulations. 3) The beneficiaries (dependants) are determined by the trustee according to scheme rules, and the employer/trustee relationship is governed by pension legislation rather than consumer protection regulations. 4) The document specifically states it is regulated by the Pensions Act and Revenue requirements, not consumer protection regulations. The settlement process described in the document follows pension scheme rules rather than consumer protection requirements.",
