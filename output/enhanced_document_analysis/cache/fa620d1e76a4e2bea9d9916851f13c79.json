  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (385) specifically governs how regulated entities must present past performance information in advertisements of financial services. After reviewing the provided pension scheme rules document, there is no content related to advertising or past performance presentations. The document is purely a legal/administrative document that outlines the rules, definitions, and operational procedures for a company pension life cover scheme. It contains sections on definitions, scheme operations, benefits, trustee duties, and wind-up procedures, but does not include any marketing materials or performance representations that would fall under the scope of regulation 385. The document is focused on establishing and governing the scheme rather than promoting or advertising it.",
