  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation specifically governs advertisements that contain references to taxation impacts, while the provided document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operational framework, definitions, and governance of a pension life cover scheme. While the document does contain references to taxation (e.g., TCA, Revenue Commissioners, tax deductions), these are not advertising claims about tax benefits but rather technical/legal references to tax compliance requirements. The document is a legal/contractual document setting out scheme rules rather than an advertisement making claims about tax benefits. Section 391 of the regulations specifically targets how tax benefits must be presented in advertisements, which is not relevant to this type of formal scheme documentation.",
