  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme, not an intermediary service agreement. 2) The document does not discuss any intermediary fees, commissions, or payment options - it only discusses employer-paid premiums (Section 2.3 states 'The employer will pay all premiums under any policy'). 3) The scheme is established directly between the employer, trustee, and AIB Life as the life office/registered administrator - there is no intermediary involvement mentioned in the document. 4) The document focuses on defining scheme rules, benefits, trustee duties, and administrative procedures rather than any fee or commission arrangements. The regulation specifically addresses intermediary fee disclosures, which are not relevant to this type of pension scheme documentation.",
