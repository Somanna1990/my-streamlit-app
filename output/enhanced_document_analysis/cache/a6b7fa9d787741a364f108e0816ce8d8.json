  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that provides death benefits only - it is not an investment product with deductions for charges and expenses over a term. 2) The scheme rules explicitly state that 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 3) While there are premiums paid by the employer, these are fixed amounts unless an indexation option applies, and are not described as having non-uniform deductions over time. 4) The document is focused on defining the rules, benefits, and administration of a death benefit scheme rather than an investment product with variable charges and expenses. The regulation specifically targets investment products with front-loaded or non-uniform charge structures, which is not relevant to this type of pension life cover scheme.",
