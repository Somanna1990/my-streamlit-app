  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (381) specifically applies to advertisements for investment products that relate to regulated activities available to consumers. The document provided is a comprehensive scheme rules document for an Executive Pension Life Cover scheme, not an advertisement. The document is a technical/legal document that outlines the rules, definitions, and operational procedures of a pension life cover scheme. It contains detailed information about scheme benefits, trustee duties, and administrative procedures. While the document is related to a financial product, it is not promotional or advertising material. The document appears to be part of the formal documentation provided to employers and trustees who are establishing or operating such a scheme, rather than advertising material aimed at consumers.",
