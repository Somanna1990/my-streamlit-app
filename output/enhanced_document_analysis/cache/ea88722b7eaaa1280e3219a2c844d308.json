  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document because: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document, not an advertisement. It is a legal/contractual document that outlines the rules, definitions, and operational procedures for a company pension life cover scheme. 2) The document's purpose is to serve as a reference document for scheme trustees, employers and members regarding the operation and benefits of the pension scheme, not to promote or advertise financial products. 3) The document contains detailed technical content like definitions, trustee duties, scheme benefits calculations, and administrative procedures that are characteristic of a rules document rather than promotional material. 4) While the document is produced by AIB life (a regulated entity), this particular document type falls outside the scope of advertising regulations as it serves a regulatory/compliance purpose rather than a promotional one.",
