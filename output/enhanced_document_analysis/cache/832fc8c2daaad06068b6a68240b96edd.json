  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that provides death benefits only - it is not an investment product as defined in the regulation. The scheme's sole purpose is explicitly stated as 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) The document outlines a pure protection product (life insurance) rather than an investment vehicle - there is no investment component that would need warnings about realisability or exit difficulties. 3) The benefits are clearly defined as lump sum payments and/or annuities payable on death, with specific rules around maximum benefits and payment conditions. There is no investment element that would require warnings about value or risk assessment. 4) The scheme is established as a trust arrangement under pension legislation rather than as an investment product requiring consumer protection warnings about realisability.",
