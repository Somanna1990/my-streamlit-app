  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a standalone death benefit pension product - it is not a bundled product offering. 2) The document describes a single product (pension life cover) with a single purpose ('The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age'). 3) There is no mention of product bundling, multiple products being sold together, or options to switch between different products within a bundle. 4) The pricing structure described is for a single product with a fixed premium unless indexation applies. The regulation specifically addresses requirements for bundled products, including cost comparisons and switching options between bundled products, which are not relevant to this standalone pension product.",
