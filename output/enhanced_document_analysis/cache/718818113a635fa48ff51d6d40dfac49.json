  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for the following reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. 2) The regulation specifically states in Section 15(b) that it does not apply to 'any service or activity set out in Schedule 1 of the MiFID Regulations 2017.' Occupational pension schemes are typically exempt from MiFID regulations as they are considered employee benefit arrangements rather than retail investment products. 3) The document describes an employer-sponsored scheme administered by trustees for the benefit of employees, which falls under pension legislation and trust law rather than consumer protection regulations. 4) The scheme is established as a retirement benefits scheme under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act and is regulated by the Pensions Authority, not primarily as a consumer financial product under Central Bank consumer protection regulations. 5) The relationship described in the document is between employer, trustee and member rather than a regulated entity and consumer relationship that these consumer protection regulations are designed to govern.",
