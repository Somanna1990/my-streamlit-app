  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the core structure and operation of an occupational pension scheme - it is not describing the sale or offering of optional extras with a financial service. 2) The scheme described is a standalone product with defined benefits and features - there is no mention of optional extras or additional purchasable features that would trigger this regulation. 3) The document explicitly states that 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' This indicates it is a single, defined product rather than one with optional add-ons. 4) While premiums and benefits are discussed, they are core elements of the product rather than optional extras that would require separate disclosure and consent under Regulation 94. 5) The document focuses on trustee duties, scheme rules, and benefit calculations rather than point-of-sale disclosures about optional features.",
