  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation applies to insurance policies where premiums may be subject to review during the term of the policy. The document is about a pension life cover scheme, which is a type of occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. While it mentions a 'policy' that will be taken out with a life office (AIB life), there is no indication in the document that the premium for this policy may be subject to review during its term. The document focuses on scheme rules, definitions, and how benefits are provided, but does not discuss premium reviews or increases. Additionally, the document states 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age,' which indicates this is a death benefit scheme rather than a standard insurance policy with reviewable premiums.",
