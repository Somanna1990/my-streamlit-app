  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document from AIB life, which is a regulated financial product. Regulation 52 requires specific information to be included in terms of business documents. While the document contains some of the required information, it lacks several mandatory elements specified in Regulation 52(1), such as clear statement about being subject to Bank codes of conduct, details about complaints procedures, and information about statutory compensation schemes.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The document identifies the regulated entity: 'Life Office Means AIB life or where AIB life agrees in writing, any other life office authorised to carry on life assurance business in Ireland.' It also provides some description of the regulated activities: 'The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.'; The scheme is a retirement benefits scheme as defined by Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA, capable of being approved by the Revenue Commissioners as an exempt approved scheme. The scheme may be established by way of a retirement benefits product as defined by Section 772A of the TCA unless premiums exceed the percentage of remuneration limits set out in the TCA, in which circumstances individual approval will be required and obtained from Revenue when the scheme is established.\nThe scheme will be registered with the Pensions Authority and the Authority will allocate a Pensions Authority reference number when the scheme is approved by Revenue. It is an occupational pension scheme for the purposes of the Pensions Act.; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member.; Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.

  "gap_description": "The document is missing several required elements from Regulation 52(1), including: (a) complete contact details of AIB life; (c) clear confirmation of authorization status; (d) statement about being subject to Bank codes of conduct; (h) general statement on how charges are imposed; (i) summary of conflict of interest policy; (k) summary of complaints procedure; (l) information about statutory compensation scheme membership; and (m) date when terms of business came into effect with confirmation they remain up to date.",
  "gap_recommendations": "AIB life should update this document to include all elements required by Regulation 52(1), specifically: add complete contact details; include clear confirmation of regulatory authorization; add a statement about compliance with Bank codes of conduct; include information about charges; add a summary of conflict of interest policy; include a summary of the complaints procedure; provide information about any statutory compensation scheme membership; and add the effective date of the terms with confirmation they remain current. These additions should be clearly presented in a dedicated section of the document.",
