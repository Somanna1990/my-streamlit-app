Add practical examples to illustrate how the scheme works in real-life scenarios.\n3. Include visual aids such as flowcharts or diagrams to explain the scheme structure and benefits.\n4. Provide a plain-language summary at the beginning of each section.\n5. Ensure definitions use simple language rather than additional technical terms.\n6. Add a FAQ section addressing common questions in straightforward language.\n7. Consider user testing the document with average consumers to identify areas of confusion.",
