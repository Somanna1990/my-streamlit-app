  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of pension scheme rules that outline the structure, operation, and governance of a pension life cover scheme. It is not a digital platform or interface through which consumers interact to obtain financial services. 2) While the document mentions AIB life and includes contact information including a mobile banking app reference, the document itself is not a digital platform - it is a legal/governance document that establishes rules for a pension scheme. 3) The regulation specifically addresses requirements for digital platforms used by consumers to access financial services, including usability testing, algorithm documentation, and consumer interaction. This document serves a different purpose as a legal framework document rather than a consumer-facing digital interface. 4) The brief mention of the AIB Mobile Banking app in Section 6 is incidental and relates to contact information rather than being part of the core purpose or content of this document.",
