  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of pension scheme rules that outline the structure, operation and benefits of a pension life cover scheme - it is not an advertisement. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, this document serves as a legal/contractual document establishing the rules of the scheme rather than promoting or advertising any financial service. 3) The regulation specifically pertains to advertisements where a regulated entity has a position or holding in the financial service being advertised. This document makes no promotional claims and instead focuses on defining terms, establishing roles and responsibilities, and detailing scheme operations. 4) The document's purpose is regulatory compliance with pension legislation and scheme governance, not marketing or advertising of financial services.",
