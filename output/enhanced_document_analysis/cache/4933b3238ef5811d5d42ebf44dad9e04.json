  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that specifically deals with death benefits before retirement age, not a serious or critical illness policy. The document clearly states 'The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) The regulation specifically pertains to serious or critical illness insurance policies and the disclosure requirements around their restrictions, conditions, and exclusions. This document instead outlines rules for an occupational pension scheme that provides death benefits. 3) The document's scope and purpose are clearly defined as a pension scheme document governed by the Pensions Act and TCA (Taxes Consolidation Act), not a critical illness insurance product. The benefits described are exclusively related to death benefits, not illness-related benefits.",
