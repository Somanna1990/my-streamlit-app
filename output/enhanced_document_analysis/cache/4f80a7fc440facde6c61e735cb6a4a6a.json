  "applicability": "Applies",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation clearly applies to the document for several reasons: 1) The document shows AIB Life outsourcing administrative duties to third parties - specifically Section 4.1 states 'The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act.' This is a clear example of outsourcing activity as defined in Regulation 119. 2) AIB Life is a regulated entity (the document states 'Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland'). 3) The document outlines a pension scheme where administrative and trustee functions are being delegated between multiple parties including employers, trustees, and AIB Life as administrator. The regulation specifically requires that any outsourced activity must comply with consumer protection regulations, which is relevant to how this pension scheme is administered and managed. The document includes specific provisions about how these outsourced relationships can be terminated (with 90 days notice) and the responsibilities of each party, showing awareness of regulatory requirements around outsourcing.",
