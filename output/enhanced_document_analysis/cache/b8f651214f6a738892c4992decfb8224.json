  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that falls under financial services regulation. While it contains some elements that align with disclosure requirements, it lacks explicit provisions about reporting to the Central Bank, handling of investigations, or procedures for disclosing matters that would require notification to the Bank under Regulation 13. The document focuses on defining the scheme and its operations rather than regulatory compliance procedures.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The document includes definitions and operational procedures, such as: 'The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' It also references regulatory frameworks: 'Administrator Means for the purposes of Chapter 1 Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 the trustee of the scheme or such other person or persons as may be appointed by the trustee with the consent of the Revenue Commissioners.'; The scheme will be registered with the Pensions Authority and the Authority will allocate a Pensions Authority reference number when the scheme is approved by Revenue. It is an occupational pension scheme for the purposes of the Pensions Act.\nThe trustee shall have the power to deduct from the proceeds of any policy any taxes or other deductions for which they are legally responsible. The trustee will not provide any benefit under the scheme that would go over the maximum benefit allowed, or conflict with requirements of the Revenue Commissioners. The trustee will reduce any benefit to ensure it does not exceed the maximum approvable benefits permitted and does not conflict with the Revenue requirements. The trustee must comply with any undertaking given to the Revenue Commissioners.; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member. Annual trustee reports and audited accounts are not required for schemes where the only benefit under the scheme is a death benefit in the event that the member dies before normal retirement age.; Within 12 weeks after a decision to wind up the pension scheme has been made or the date on which the trustee first becomes aware or ought reasonably to have been aware that an event has occurred which requires the scheme to be wound up, notification must be sent to the member (or other persons entitled to receive benefits under the scheme) and the Pensions Authority that a decision has been made, or an event has occurred, to wind up the scheme.",
  "gap_description": "The document lacks specific provisions addressing: 1) Procedures for disclosing matters to the Central Bank that would reasonably require notification; 2) Processes for reporting suspected contraventions or other regulatory issues; 3) Commitments to respond to regulatory requests in an open and timely manner; 4) Procedures to ensure non-destruction of relevant information or records; 5) Guidelines for cooperation during investigations.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1) Add a specific section on regulatory compliance that addresses obligations under Regulation 13; 2) Include procedures for identifying and reporting matters requiring disclosure to the Central Bank; 3) Establish clear protocols for cooperation with regulatory investigations; 4) Develop record-keeping standards that ensure information is preserved for regulatory purposes; 5) Include commitments to provide accurate information and cooperate with the Central Bank in good faith.",
