  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the pension life cover scheme document for several reasons: 1) The document describes a pension scheme that provides death benefits only if the member dies before normal retirement age - this falls under exception (b) of the regulation which excludes 'protection policies where the settlement amount is set out in the policy's terms and conditions'. The document clearly defines the benefit calculations and maximum amounts in Section 3. 2) The scheme is specifically a company pension scheme governed by the Pensions Act and TCA (Taxes Consolidation Act), not a general insurance product. 3) The document outlines that claims are paid according to pre-defined rules and calculations based on final remuneration and years of service, with specific maximum benefit limits set by Revenue. There is no negotiation of settlement amounts that would require the 10-day consideration period described in the regulation. 4) The benefits are held in trust and paid out according to trustee discretion within defined parameters, rather than through a direct insurance claim settlement process.",
