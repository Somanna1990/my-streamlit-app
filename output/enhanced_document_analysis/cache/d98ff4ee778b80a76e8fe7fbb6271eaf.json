  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation clearly applies to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page states 'Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland'). 2) The document contains both regulated pension activities and potentially unregulated activities (like certain trustee services). 3) The document needs to clearly distinguish between regulated and unregulated activities as per Regulation 73. The document does make some distinctions regarding regulatory oversight - for example, it mentions Revenue Commissioners' approval and Pensions Authority registration, but should also clearly identify which aspects fall under Central Bank regulation. The document would need to include appropriate warnings about unregulated activities as required by 73(1)(c). Since this is a core scheme rules document that outlines both regulated insurance products and trustee services, it falls squarely within the scope of this regulation requiring clear distinction between regulated and unregulated activities.",
