  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation requires regulated entities to include a regulatory disclosure statement on business stationery, webpages, and electronic communications related to regulated activities. The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document from a regulated entity (AIB life), which constitutes business stationery used in connection with regulated activities. However, the document does not contain the required regulatory disclosure statement in the format specified by Regulation 71(4).",
  "compliance_evidence": "",
  "gap_description": "The document does not include the mandatory regulatory disclosure statement that should state either '[Full legal name of the regulated entity], [trading as - insert all trading names used by that regulated entity relevant to the financial service concerned] is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland' or the alternative format for entities authorized in other Member States. This statement is completely absent from the document.",
  "gap_recommendations": "Add the required regulatory disclosure statement in the format specified in Regulation 71(4) to the document. This should appear prominently, possibly on the cover page or in the introductory sections. The statement should read 'AIB life is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland' (assuming AIB life is the full legal name) or include the trading name if different from the legal name. If AIB life is authorized in another Member State, use the alternative format specified in 71(4)(b).",
