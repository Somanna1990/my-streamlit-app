  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the pension life cover scheme document for several reasons: 1) The document is issued by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page). 2) The scheme involves financial services through a life insurance policy and pension arrangements, making it subject to financial services regulations. 3) The document establishes a trust relationship and involves vulnerable scenarios like death benefits and dependants' rights, which align with the financial abuse protection requirements in Regulation 10. 4) The document includes sections on trustee duties and scheme administration that would need to incorporate financial abuse controls. 5) The scheme involves payment processing, beneficiary designations, and digital communications (mentioned in Section 6) that require protection against financial abuse as specified in the regulation. The document would need to comply with the regulation's requirements for systems and controls to prevent financial abuse, especially given the sensitive nature of death benefits and pension arrangements.",
