  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that specifically outlines death benefits payable before retirement age - it is not an investment product as defined in the regulation. The scheme's main and only purpose as stated is 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) The document explicitly states it is governed by the Pensions Act 1990 and falls under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA as a retirement benefits scheme. 3) The regulation specifically exempts products where information disclosure is already covered by the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2001, which would apply to this type of life assurance product. 4) The document does not involve investment decisions or choices by the consumer - it is a pure protection product paying out a defined death benefit. Therefore, the investment product disclosure requirements outlined in regulation 371 are not relevant to this type of product.",
