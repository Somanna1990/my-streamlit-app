  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that only provides death benefits before retirement age - it is not a life insurance policy with surrender value. This is explicitly stated in Section 3.4: 'The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age. If the member reaches normal retirement age, the member will not be entitled to any benefits.' 2) There is no surrender value or early termination value for the member since the policy only pays out on death before retirement age. 3) The document makes no mention of surrender values or policy sales because this type of pension death benefit scheme is not designed to have those features. The regulation specifically pertains to life insurance policies with surrender values and potential secondary market sales, which is fundamentally different from this type of pension death benefit scheme.",
