  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation specifically addresses refunds due to consumers as a result of errors made by regulated entities. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of a company pension scheme. While AIB Life is mentioned as a regulated entity in the document, these scheme rules do not contain any provisions related to consumer refunds due to errors. The document instead focuses on defining the terms, benefits, and operational aspects of the pension scheme, including trustee duties and scheme wind-up procedures. The refund provisions mentioned in the document (section 2.4) relate specifically to excess proceeds from pension benefits exceeding Revenue Commissioner limits, which is different from refunds due to errors as covered by the regulation. Additionally, this is a business-to-business document establishing a trust arrangement rather than a consumer-facing product document.",
