  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation in question (Regulation 34 - Consumers in vulnerable circumstances to be assisted) does not apply to this document because the document is a set of pension scheme rules that outline the structure, definitions, and operation of a company pension life cover scheme. The document does not contain operational procedures for how the regulated entity (AIB life) interacts with consumers in vulnerable circumstances. This document is a legal framework document that establishes the rules of the pension scheme rather than a customer-facing or operational document that would address how staff should handle vulnerable customers. The regulation specifically addresses how regulated entities should provide assistance to consumers in vulnerable circumstances, which would be more appropriately addressed in customer service policies, staff training materials, or operational procedure documents rather than in scheme rules.",
