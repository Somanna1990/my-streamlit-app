  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines how a regulated financial entity (AIB life) provides services to consumers. Regulation 121 requires that regulated entities process all instructions from consumers properly and promptly. While the document establishes a framework for the scheme's operation, it does not explicitly address the processing of consumer instructions or specify timeframes for processing such instructions. There is an implied processing of instructions in section 2.1, but no clear statement about how promptly these will be handled.",
  "compliance_evidence": "2.1 Commencement and continuation of the scheme\na. If the employer is appointed as the trustee\nOn or after the start date of the scheme, the trustee will take out a policy with the life office and may, at a later date, change that policy or take out a further policy or policies with the life office for the benefit of the member's dependants.; c. The policy will pay out a lump sum to the trustee if the member dies while in service of the employer, provided the policy is in force at the time of death and a valid claim is made.; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member.; The trustee's powers will include, but not be limited to: [...] make all necessary arrangements for dealing with receipts and payments under the scheme and may authorise that cheques be drawn or endorsed by such one or more of the trustee(s) or by such other person (if any) as they may appoint for the purpose and may give, vary or revoke instructions as to the custody and disposal of any policies and securities and as to the signature of proposal forms and certificates of membership and the giving of receipts and discharges in connection with the scheme on behalf of the trustee(s) and every such receipt and discharge shall be as valid and effective as if it were given by the trustee(s);",
  "gap_description": "The document lacks explicit provisions regarding the processing of instructions from consumers (members, employers, or trustees) and does not specify timeframes or standards for prompt processing. There is no clear statement about how AIB life will handle instructions, what constitutes 'properly and promptly', or what consumers can expect regarding instruction processing times.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Add a specific section addressing how instructions from consumers will be processed, including defined timeframes.\n2. Include details on what constitutes 'proper' processing of instructions.\n3. Specify the channels through which instructions can be submitted.\n4. Add information about confirmation of instruction receipt and processing.\n5. Include remedies or compensation if instructions are not processed properly or promptly.",
