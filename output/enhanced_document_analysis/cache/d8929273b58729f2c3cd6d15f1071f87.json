  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the pension life cover scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is focused on establishing rules for a company pension life cover scheme and does not contain any provisions or procedures related to powers of attorney. 2) While the document discusses trustees, beneficiaries, and administrative powers, it does not address scenarios where someone might act on behalf of a consumer through a power of attorney. 3) The document's scope is specifically limited to defining scheme rules, trustee duties, and benefit provisions for company pensions in the event of death before retirement age. 4) The only parties mentioned in terms of authority are the trustees, employers, and administrators - there is no mention of power of attorney arrangements or procedures for handling them. 5) The document's administrative sections (particularly Section 4 on Trustee Duties and Powers) do not include any requirements for handling power of attorney situations.",
