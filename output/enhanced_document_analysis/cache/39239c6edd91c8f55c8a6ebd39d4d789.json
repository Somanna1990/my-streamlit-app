  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, benefits, and administration of a pension death benefit scheme. It does not contain any provisions or systems related to complaint handling or management. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the administrator and is a regulated entity, this specific document's purpose is to establish and govern the pension scheme rules rather than outline operational procedures for complaint handling. 3) The document's scope is limited to defining the scheme's structure, trustee duties, benefit calculations, and wind-up procedures. There are no sections addressing customer complaint processes or systems. 4) The 'Contacting Us' section only provides basic contact information and does not describe complaint handling procedures or systems. The regulation specifically requires systems to track and manage complaints, which is outside the scope and purpose of this scheme rules document.",
