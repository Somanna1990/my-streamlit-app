  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme administered by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (as noted at the end of the document). 2) The scheme involves direct interaction with consumers through various functions including administration, claims processing, and benefit payments to dependants. 3) The document specifically deals with situations involving vulnerable circumstances, such as death benefits and payments to dependants, including children and spouses. 4) The document outlines trustee duties and administrative functions that would require staff training on handling vulnerable circumstances, particularly when dealing with death claims and bereaved dependants. 5) Section 6 of the document provides for direct consumer contact through customer service channels. Given these factors, AIB life would need to ensure relevant staff receive appropriate training on handling vulnerable circumstances as required by Regulation 35, particularly for those involved in consumer-facing roles and claims processing.",
