  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operational framework and governance of a pension life cover scheme - it is not an advertisement. 2) The document content focuses on defining terms, explaining scheme benefits, trustee duties, and administrative procedures rather than promotional or advertising material. 3) While the document is from AIB Life, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, this particular document type (scheme rules) falls under pension legislation and Revenue Commissioner oversight rather than advertising regulations. 4) The regulation specifically pertains to the review and updating of advertisements, while this document serves as a legal/contractual framework document that would be updated based on legislative or scheme requirement changes, not advertising compliance requirements.",
