  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of scheme rules that governs how a pension life cover scheme operates, rather than a log or record-keeping system for errors. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as a regulated entity, this specific document does not contain or relate to error logging procedures - it is purely focused on defining the terms, benefits, and administration of the pension scheme. 3) The document's purpose is to establish the legal framework and operational rules for a pension scheme, not to document operational errors or consumer impacts. 4) The content is entirely focused on scheme definitions, trustee duties, benefit calculations, and scheme administration - there are no provisions or sections related to error tracking or consumer remediation. 5) While AIB Life would need to maintain error logs as a regulated entity under this regulation, that requirement would be separate from these scheme rules.",
