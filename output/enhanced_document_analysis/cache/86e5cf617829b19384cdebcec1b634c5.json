  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of a pension life cover scheme - it is not a website or webpage content. 2) While AIB life is mentioned as a regulated entity (regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland as stated at the end of the document), this particular document is not related to website content or the separation of regulated vs unregulated activities on a website. 3) The document's purpose is to define the rules, benefits, and trustee duties for an occupational pension scheme, not to present consumer-facing website information. The regulation specifically addresses how regulated entities must structure their website content, which is not relevant to this internal scheme rules document.",
