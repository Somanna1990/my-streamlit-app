  "applicability": "Applies",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation clearly applies to the document for several reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme where Section 2.3 explicitly states 'The premium is a fixed amount unless an indexation or annual increase option applies to the policy, or if changes are made to the policy.' This indicates the premium may be subject to review. 2) Section 2.3 also mentions 'Cover amounts can be amended in the future in line with the employer's wishes.' This further confirms the premium may be subject to change. 3) The document is from AIB life, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (stated at the end of the document), making it subject to these regulations. 4) The document represents the type of insurance policy documentation that Regulation 337 specifically targets - one where premiums may be subject to review during the policy term. The regulation requires clear disclosure of potential premium increases and fixed premium periods, which is relevant to this pension life cover scheme's premium structure.",
