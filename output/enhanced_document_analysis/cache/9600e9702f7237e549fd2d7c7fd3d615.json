  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (CPC 355 on Claims Handling Procedures) does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, definitions and operation of a pension scheme - it is not a claims handling procedure document. 2) While the document mentions claims in Section 3 regarding death benefits, it does not establish or detail the actual claims handling procedures that would be required under CPC 355. 3) The document is focused on defining the scheme rules, trustee duties, and benefit structures rather than operational procedures for handling claims. 4) The claims handling requirements specified in CPC 355 (like providing PIRB guides, MIBI referrals, claim forms within 5 days, etc.) are operational requirements that would be detailed in separate claims handling procedure documents maintained by AIB Life, not in scheme rules documentation. 5) This appears to be a product documentation/scheme rules document rather than an operational procedures document that would need to comply with CPC 355.",
