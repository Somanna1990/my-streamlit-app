  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document issued by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (as noted in the footer 'Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland'). 2) The document outlines consumer-facing financial products and services, specifically pension and life cover schemes, which fall under the consumer protection mandate of the Central Bank. 3) The document contains provisions that directly impact consumers' rights and protections, including benefit payments, trustee duties, and scheme administration. 4) The document includes sections on consumer communication and contact (Section 6) which would be subject to consumer protection regulations. Since AIB life is a regulated entity providing regulated financial services to consumers, any failure to comply with the provisions outlined in this document would constitute a prescribed contravention under Regulation 420 of the Consumer Protection Regulations.",
