  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation regarding information barriers does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation and administration of a single-member pension death benefit scheme. It does not deal with information barriers or segregation between different business areas. 2) The scheme is specifically designed for a single member only, as stated in Section 2.2: 'The scheme is established for that one person only and that one person will always be the only member.' This means there is limited scope for conflicts of interest between different customers. 3) While the document mentions trustees and administrators, it focuses on their duties regarding benefit administration and scheme management, not information handling between different business units. 4) The document is primarily concerned with defining benefits, eligibility, and operational procedures rather than internal information management practices. The regulation in question specifically deals with information barriers between different employees, business areas, and connected parties to prevent conflicts of interest - none of which are relevant to the core purpose and function of this pension scheme document.",
