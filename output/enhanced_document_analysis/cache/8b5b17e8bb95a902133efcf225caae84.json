  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation requires that a regulated entity's name, including any company name and trading name, be clearly specified in all advertisements. This document appears to be a pension scheme rules document that could be considered promotional material. While the document does mention 'AIB life' multiple times as the life office providing the assurance, it does not consistently or prominently display the full legal entity name of AIB life, nor does it clearly specify whether 'AIB life' is a trading name or the full company name. The document lacks proper company identification that would fully satisfy the regulatory requirement.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The document mentions 'AIB life' in several places, including: \"The benefits payable under the scheme will be provided by means of an assurance or assurances, to be issued by AIB life.\" and \"Life Office Means AIB life or where AIB life agrees in writing, any other life office authorised to carry on life assurance business in Ireland.\" and \"Qualifying Fund Manager As defined in Chapter 2, Part 30 of the TCA. AIB life is a qualifying fund manager.\"; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member.; Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Registered in Ireland number 701277, VAT number 3804332MH.",
  "gap_description": "The document does not clearly specify the full legal entity name of AIB life (e.g., whether it's 'AIB Life Insurance Limited' or another legal entity name). It's unclear if 'AIB life' is a trading name or the full company name. The document should clearly state the full legal entity name along with any trading name to fully comply with the regulation.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Add the full legal entity name of AIB life (e.g., 'AIB Life Insurance Limited' or whatever the correct legal entity name is) consistently throughout the document. 2. Clearly indicate if 'AIB life' is a trading name by stating something like 'AIB Life Insurance Limited trading as AIB life'. 3. Add this information prominently at the beginning of the document, possibly in a footer on each page, and in any sections discussing the provider of the policy. 4. Include a regulatory disclosure section that clearly states the company's full legal name, registration details, and regulatory status.",
