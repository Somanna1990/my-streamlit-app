  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document, which is not an investment product - it is a pure protection product that only pays out on death before retirement age. The document explicitly states 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) The document describes an occupational pension scheme death benefit, which is governed by pension legislation and the Pensions Authority, not investment product regulations. 3) The regulation in question specifically relates to information that must be provided about investment products, while this document contains no investment elements or components - it is purely a death benefit scheme. 4) The document is a set of scheme rules rather than product documentation provided to intermediaries for sales purposes. The rules govern how the scheme operates rather than serving as product information for distribution purposes.",
