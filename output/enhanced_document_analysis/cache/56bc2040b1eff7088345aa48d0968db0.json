  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure and operation of a pension death benefit scheme, not an insurance intermediary pricing document. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office provider, the document focuses on trustee duties, scheme benefits, and administrative procedures rather than pricing or renewal pricing mechanisms. 3) The document makes no mention of insurance intermediary involvement in price setting or renewal pricing - it only discusses fixed premiums paid by employers (Section 2.3 states 'The premium is a fixed amount unless an indexation or annual increase option applies to the policy'). 4) The scheme described is a single-member occupational pension scheme providing death benefits, which is fundamentally different from the type of insurance policy renewals that Regulation 317 is designed to govern.",
