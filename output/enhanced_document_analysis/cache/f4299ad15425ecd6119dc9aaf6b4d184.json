  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is for a pension life cover scheme administered by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page). 2) The document contains multiple sections dealing with fees, commissions, and trustee powers that could create conflicts of interest. Specifically, Section 4 on Trustee Duties and Powers gives trustees broad authority over financial decisions and administration, while acknowledging potential conflicts ('No decision of the trustee will be invalidated by reason of the trustee having a direct or personal interest'). 3) The scheme involves financial products and services where conflicts around fees and commissions could arise, particularly in sections 2.3 (Premiums) and 4.5 (Additional Trustee Powers) which deal with financial arrangements and payments. 4) The document explicitly states AIB life is a regulated entity, making consumer protection regulations directly applicable. The regulation's focus on avoiding conflicts of interest in fees, commission structures, and business arrangements is directly relevant to how this pension scheme must be administered and sold.",
