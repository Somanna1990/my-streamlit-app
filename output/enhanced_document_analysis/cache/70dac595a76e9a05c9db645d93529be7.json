  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a death benefit pension scheme, not an investment product. The scheme's main and only purpose is explicitly stated as 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) While the document is related to a financial product, it is specifically a pure protection product (life insurance) rather than an investment product. The benefits are fixed amounts paid on death and do not have an investment component. 3) The document focuses on defining scheme rules, trustee duties, and benefit calculations rather than product distribution or sales processes. 4) The regulation in question (410) specifically applies to investment products and their target markets, while this document pertains to a protection-only insurance scheme with no investment element. The scheme rules show this is a risk-only product designed to provide death benefits, not an investment vehicle.",
