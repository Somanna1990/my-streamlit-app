  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that is purely a death benefit product - it is not an investment product as specified in the regulation. The document explicitly states 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) There is no maturity date or encashment option for the member, as the product only pays out upon death before retirement age. The document clearly states 'If the member reaches normal retirement age, the member will not be entitled to any benefits.' 3) The product is structured as a pure protection product through a trust arrangement rather than an investment vehicle. The regulation specifically pertains to investment products and their encashment/early redemption features, which are not relevant to this type of death benefit scheme.",
