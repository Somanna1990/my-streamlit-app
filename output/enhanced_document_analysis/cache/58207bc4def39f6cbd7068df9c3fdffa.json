  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation specifically addresses requirements for providing information about product bundling during telephone communications with consumers. The document in question is a comprehensive pension scheme rules document that appears to be designed for written/printed delivery rather than telephone communications. The document is a formal policy document containing detailed scheme rules, definitions, and procedures that would be provided to trustees and members in written form. There is no indication in the document of any telephone-based sales or communication processes. The contact section (Section 6) does mention phone contact but only for general customer service purposes, not for product sales or bundling discussions. Additionally, this appears to be a standalone pension life cover product rather than a bundled product, so regulations specific to bundling would not apply.",
