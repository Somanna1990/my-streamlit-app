  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically pertains to charges related to loan provision/arrangement to personal consumers, while this document outlines rules for an executive pension life cover scheme. 2) The document describes an insurance/pension product that provides death benefits to dependants, not a loan product. 3) While the document discusses premiums and payments, these are insurance premiums paid by employers, not loan charges to personal consumers. 4) The scheme described is an occupational pension scheme governed by the Pensions Act and TCA (Taxes Consolidation Act), not a loan product subject to consumer credit regulations. 5) The document makes no mention of loan arrangements, charges related to loans, or incorporation of charges into loan amounts - all of which are the specific focus of Regulation 67.",
