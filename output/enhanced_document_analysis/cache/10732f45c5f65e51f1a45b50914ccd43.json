  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of a company pension life cover scheme, not an advertisement by an intermediary. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office provider, this document serves as the legal framework and rules for operating the pension scheme rather than advertising material. 3) The document clearly identifies AIB Life's role as the registered administrator and life office provider, but this is in the context of scheme administration rather than intermediary advertising. 4) The document's purpose is to define scheme rules, benefits, trustee duties and operational procedures rather than promote or advertise financial services. The regulation specifically pertains to intermediaries advertising their services, which is not the purpose or content of this document.",
