  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (418) specifically deals with the revocation of previous regulations related to licensed moneylenders and insurance requirements. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme. The document is governed by different regulatory frameworks, specifically: 1) The Pensions Act 1990, 2) The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and 3) Revenue Commissioner requirements. The document makes no reference to consumer lending or general insurance matters that would fall under the scope of the revoked regulations mentioned in Section 418. Additionally, as this is an occupational pension scheme document primarily dealing with employer-trustee relationships and death benefits, it falls outside the scope of the consumer protection regulations being revoked. The document is instead regulated by pension-specific legislation and tax law.",
