  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document from AIB Life, which is a regulated financial service. Regulation 17 on assessing and ensuring suitability applies to this document. The document shows some elements of suitability assessment by defining the scheme's purpose and eligibility criteria, but lacks explicit provisions for assessing whether the product meets a consumer's needs, objectives, financial commitments, risk tolerance, and whether more suitable options are available as required by Regulation 17(2)-(5).",
  "compliance_evidence": "The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age. [...] An employee or director of the employer shall be eligible for inclusion in the scheme at the employer's discretion.; The trustee will not provide any benefit under the scheme that would go over the maximum benefit allowed, or conflict with requirements of the Revenue Commissioners. The trustee will reduce any benefit to ensure it does not exceed the maximum approvable benefits permitted and does not conflict with the Revenue requirements.; The maximum pension that could be provided for a member at normal retirement age is 2/3rds of final remuneration of the member, calculated in one of two ways: i. 1/60th of the final remuneration of the member for each year of service with the same employer to a maximum of 40 years service (ignoring all retained pension benefits); or ii. Where a member's number of completed years of service with the employer is less than 40, they can fund for a pension of 2/3rds of the final remuneration of the member over a shorter period, using the uplifted scale of benefits outlined in the table below.",
  "gap_description": "The document does not include provisions for: 1) Assessing whether the scheme meets the consumer's needs and objectives; 2) Evaluating if the consumer can meet financial commitments; 3) Determining if the consumer can bear the risks; 4) Ensuring consistency with the consumer's attitude to risk; 5) Confirming this is the most suitable product from available options; 6) Documenting the suitability assessment process.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1) Add a section on suitability assessment that explicitly addresses the requirements in Regulation 17(2)-(5); 2) Include a mandatory pre-enrollment suitability assessment process; 3) Create a template or checklist for documenting suitability assessments; 4) Add provisions requiring comparison with other available options to ensure this is the most suitable product; 5) Include criteria for assessing the consumer's ability to meet financial commitments and bear risks; 6) Add requirements to match the product with the consumer's documented attitude to risk.",
