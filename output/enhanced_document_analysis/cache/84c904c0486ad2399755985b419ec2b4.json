  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of an occupational pension scheme - it is not an insurance quotation document. 2) While the document mentions premiums in Section 2.3, it does not discuss or contain any quotations, discounts, or loadings that would fall under Regulation 330's requirements. 3) The document's purpose is to establish scheme rules and governance rather than provide insurance quotations to consumers. 4) The document appears to be focused on business-to-business relationships (employer-trustee-administrator) rather than direct consumer interactions that would trigger consumer protection quotation requirements. The regulation specifically addresses insurance quotations provided to consumers, which is not the purpose or content of this scheme rules document.",
