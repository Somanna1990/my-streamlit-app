  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of rules governing an executive pension life cover scheme and does not contain any sales or marketing content or procedures. 2) The document focuses on defining the legal and operational framework of the pension scheme, including definitions, benefits, trustee duties, and administrative procedures. 3) While Section 6 provides contact information for AIB life, this is purely for service purposes and not for sales/marketing activities. 4) The regulation specifically addresses how regulated entities should handle consumer instructions regarding sales and marketing visits/calls, which is not within the scope of this scheme rules document. The document is a legal/administrative document that establishes and governs a pension scheme rather than a sales or marketing document.",
