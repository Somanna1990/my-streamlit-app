  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page), making it a 'regulated entity' under the regulation. 2) The document outlines processes for handling consumer instructions, particularly around pension scheme benefits, trustee duties, and claims processing. Specifically, sections 3.1-3.3 detail how claims and benefit instructions must be processed, and section 4.5 outlines trustee powers regarding processing receipts, payments, and instructions. The document establishes procedures for handling consumer instructions 'properly and promptly' as required by Regulation 121. 3) The document includes specific timeframes and procedures for processing various consumer instructions, such as the 12-week notification requirement for scheme wind-up (section 5.1) and procedures for processing death benefit claims. These align with the regulation's requirement for proper and prompt processing of consumer instructions.",
