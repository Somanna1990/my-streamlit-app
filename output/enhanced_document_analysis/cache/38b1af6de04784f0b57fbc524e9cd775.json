  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is focused entirely on domestic pension life cover scheme rules and does not mention any foreign currency denominated products or services. 2) All benefits and premiums described in the document appear to be denominated in euros (€) only, as evidenced by references to euro amounts like '€6,350' and '€330'. 3) There is no indication in the document that the pension benefits or premiums could be affected by currency exchange rates. 4) The scheme is specifically designed for Irish employers and employees, operating under Irish tax law (TCA) and pension regulations. The document shows no international or foreign currency elements that would trigger the currency exchange rate warning requirement under Regulation 396.",
