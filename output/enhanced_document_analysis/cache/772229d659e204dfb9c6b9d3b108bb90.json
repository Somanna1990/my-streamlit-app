  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document for several reasons: 1) The regulation specifically pertains to insurance quotations provided on digital platforms and subsequent telephone follow-ups, while this document is a comprehensive scheme rules document for an executive pension life cover product. 2) The document outlines the formal rules, definitions, and operational procedures of a pension scheme rather than dealing with quotation or sales processes. 3) The document is focused on trustee duties, scheme benefits, and administrative procedures rather than consumer communication channels or marketing practices. 4) While the document does include contact information for AIB life, it does not discuss quotation processes or digital platform interactions that would fall under the scope of Regulation 339. The regulation is specifically about obtaining consent for follow-up calls after digital quotations, which is not relevant to the content or purpose of these scheme rules.",
