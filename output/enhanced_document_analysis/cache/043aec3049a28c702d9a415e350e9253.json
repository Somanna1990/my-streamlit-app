  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme administered by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page). 2) The document contains multiple sections dealing with trustee duties and potential conflicts of interest, particularly in Section 4.5 which specifically addresses situations where trustees may have 'direct or personal interest' in decisions. 3) The document outlines a complex financial product involving multiple parties (employer, trustee, administrator, life office) where conflicts of interest could arise. 4) Section 4.1 establishes AIB life as a registered administrator with specific duties, making it a regulated entity subject to these regulations. 5) The document explicitly states that 'No decision of the trustee will be invalidated by reason of the trustee having a direct or personal interest in the result of any such decision...provided that such trustee had disclosed any such interest,' which directly relates to conflict of interest management as required by the regulation. Given these factors, the regulated entity (AIB life) must maintain and adhere to a conflicts of interest policy as specified in the regulation.",

(1) A regulated entity shall establish, maintain and adhere to a robust conflicts of interest policy appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of the regulated activities carried out by the regulated entity. (2) The conflicts of interest policy referred to in paragraph (1) shall with reference to its regulated activities - (a) identify the circumstances which constitute, or may give rise to, a conflict of interest with respect to its consumers, including those conflicts that are the subject of Regulation 23, and (b) specify procedures to be followed, and measures to be adopted, to properly identify and manage any conflicts identified, excluding those conflicts that are the subject of the obligation referred to in Regulation 23 and which therefore must be avoided.",
