  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The regulation specifically pertains to telephone conversations and electronic communications relating to client order services for investment products. The document is a set of pension scheme rules that outlines the structure, benefits, and administration of a company pension life cover scheme. 2) While the document includes contact information for AIB life, it does not describe or establish procedures for recording telephone conversations or electronic communications related to investment orders. 3) The scheme described is a pure protection product (life cover) rather than an investment product - its sole purpose as stated in Section 3.4 is 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 4) The document focuses on defining the scheme rules, trustee duties, and benefit calculations rather than dealing with communication recording requirements or order execution procedures. Therefore, regulation 407 regarding the recording of telephone conversations for investment orders is not applicable to this type of pension life cover scheme document.",
