  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of scheme rules for a company pension life cover product and does not contain any advertisements or marketing materials. 2) While the document describes benefits and terms of the pension scheme, it does not make any guarantees or use terms conveying guarantee impressions that would trigger regulation 390. 3) The document is primarily focused on defining the legal and operational framework of the pension scheme, including definitions, trustee duties, scheme benefits, and administrative procedures. The only mentions of 'guarantee' in the document are in section 4.5 regarding trustee powers to give guarantees in an administrative context, not in relation to product marketing or consumer communications. The regulation specifically targets how investment products are advertised and described to consumers, which is not the purpose or content of this document.",
