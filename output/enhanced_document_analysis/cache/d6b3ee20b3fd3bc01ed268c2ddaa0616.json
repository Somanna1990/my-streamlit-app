  "gap_description": "While the document includes definitions and attempts to structure information, it still contains technical terms without sufficient explanation (e.g., 'annuity equivalent of retirement lump sums'). The document could better highlight key information for customers and simplify some complex concepts. Some sections use technical language that may be difficult for an average customer to understand without financial expertise.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Further simplify technical language throughout the document, particularly in sections discussing tax implications and benefits calculations.\n2. Add visual elements or text formatting to highlight key information that customers need to understand.\n3. Include practical examples to illustrate complex concepts.\n4. Add a summary section at the beginning that outlines the most important aspects of the scheme in plain language.\n5. Consider adding a glossary for unavoidable technical terms with more detailed explanations.",
