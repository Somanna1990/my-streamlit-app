  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (393) specifically pertains to advertisements of financial services where returns are determined on particular dates. The document provided is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operational rules, definitions, and procedures for a company pension scheme. While the document does contain information about benefits and payments, it is not an advertisement and does not discuss advertised returns determined on particular dates. The document is a legal/procedural document that establishes the framework for the pension scheme rather than promotional material. The regulation's specific focus on advertising and return dates makes it clearly inapplicable to this type of document.",
