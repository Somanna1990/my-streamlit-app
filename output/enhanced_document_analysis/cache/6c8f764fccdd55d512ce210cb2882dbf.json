  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of a pension scheme, not a complaints handling procedure. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, this document specifically deals with the trust structure, benefits, and administration of the pension scheme rather than operational procedures like complaints handling. 3) The document makes no mention of consumer complaints processes or governance arrangements for handling complaints. 4) The scheme described is an occupational pension scheme governed primarily by the Pensions Act and Revenue requirements, not consumer protection regulations. 5) The relationship described in the document is between employer, trustee and member rather than a direct consumer relationship that would fall under consumer protection regulations for complaints handling.",
