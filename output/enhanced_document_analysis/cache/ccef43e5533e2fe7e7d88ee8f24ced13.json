  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically addresses cooling-off periods for services provided through digital platforms, while this document is a comprehensive scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a pension life cover scheme. 2) While the document mentions AIB life and includes contact information, it does not discuss or establish any cooling-off or withdrawal periods that would trigger this regulatory requirement. 3) The document is primarily focused on defining the rules, benefits, and trustee responsibilities for an occupational pension scheme rather than describing consumer rights related to digital platform services. 4) The document appears to be governed primarily by the Pensions Act and Tax Consolidation Act rather than consumer protection regulations related to digital services. The nature of the product (an employer-established pension scheme) is fundamentally different from the type of consumer financial services contemplated by the cooling-off period regulation.",
