  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of scheme rules that outlines how the pension life cover scheme works, its benefits, and trustee duties - it does not contain any procedures or processes for handling customer errors or complaints. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, this document specifically deals with the structure and governance of the pension scheme itself rather than AIB Life's consumer protection obligations. 3) The document's scope is limited to defining the relationship between the employer (as trustee), the member, and AIB Life in administering death benefits - it does not cover consumer error resolution processes which would fall under separate consumer protection documentation. 4) The regulatory oversight mentioned in the document relates to pension legislation and Revenue requirements, not consumer protection regulations. 5) Any error resolution procedures that AIB Life must maintain as a regulated entity would be documented in their internal procedures rather than in scheme rules provided to clients.",
