  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of scheme rules that governs how a pension life cover scheme operates - it does not deal with direct consumer payments or receipts. 2) The document indicates this is an employer-sponsored scheme where 'The employer will pay all premiums under any policy' (Section 2.3), not the consumer/member directly. 3) The scheme is structured as a trust arrangement with trustees managing the scheme, not as a direct consumer financial product requiring receipts. 4) The document focuses on defining benefits, trustee duties, and scheme operations rather than payment processing or consumer transactions. While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office provider, the regulation about providing receipts for direct consumer payments does not apply to this type of pension scheme structure where premiums are paid by employers.",
