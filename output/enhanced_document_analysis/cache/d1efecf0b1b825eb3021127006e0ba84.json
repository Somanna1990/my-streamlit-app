  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a comprehensive set of scheme rules for an executive pension life cover product that clearly and accurately describes its nature and benefits throughout. The name 'Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme' accurately reflects that it is a death benefit scheme providing coverage for executives/employees through their employer. 2) The document explicitly states its main purpose in Section 1 under 'The Scheme' definition: 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' This aligns perfectly with the product name. 3) The document provides detailed explanations of all benefits, limitations, and conditions in clear language, with no evidence of misleading naming or marketing. 4) The product name accurately conveys that it is a pension-related life cover scheme, which matches exactly what the product delivers according to the detailed rules provided. Therefore, there is no violation of the regulation regarding misleading naming of financial services.",
