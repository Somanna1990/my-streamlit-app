  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a complete set of pension scheme rules, not a terms of business document that would be subject to revision notifications under Regulation 62. 2) The document represents the foundational rules of a pension scheme established under the Pensions Act and TCA, rather than ongoing terms of business between a regulated entity and consumers. 3) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, this document establishes the trust structure and scheme rules rather than the terms of business between AIB Life and customers. 4) Any changes to these scheme rules would be governed by Section 4.2 of the document which specifies the process for scheme alterations, and by pension legislation, rather than by the consumer protection regulations regarding terms of business changes. 5) The document is clearly labeled as 'Scheme Rules' and functions as a trust deed rather than as terms of business documentation.",
