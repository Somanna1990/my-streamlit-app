  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation specifically governs the conditions under which regulated entities can initiate telephone calls with existing customers. The document in question is a Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document that outlines the rules, definitions, and operations of a pension life cover scheme. While the document does include contact information and mentions AIB life (a regulated entity), it does not contain any policies or procedures related to initiating telephone calls with customers. The document's scope is limited to defining the structure, benefits, and administration of the pension scheme. Section 6 'Contacting Us' only provides passive contact information for customers to reach AIB life, rather than policies about AIB life initiating contact with customers. Therefore, CPC Regulation 109 regarding telephone call initiation is not relevant to the content or purpose of this document.",
