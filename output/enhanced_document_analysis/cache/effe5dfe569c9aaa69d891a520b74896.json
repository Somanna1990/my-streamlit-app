  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (54) specifically governs the use of the term 'independent' by financial intermediaries. After reviewing the pension scheme rules document, it is clear that this is a document outlining the rules and operation of a company pension life cover scheme administered by AIB Life, not marketing or descriptive material about an intermediary's services. While the document does mention 'Independent trustee' in a few places, this is used in a governance context rather than as a marketing term or business description. The document is focused on defining the scheme rules, benefits, trustee duties and operational procedures rather than describing intermediary services. Additionally, the document clearly identifies AIB Life as the provider/administrator rather than positioning itself as an independent intermediary. The regulation's scope is specifically about intermediaries using the term 'independent' in their business descriptions and marketing, which is not relevant to this type of operational/legal document.",
