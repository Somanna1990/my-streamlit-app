  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of a pension life cover scheme, not a terms of business document. 2) The document is specifically labeled as 'Scheme Rules' and contains detailed provisions about the operation of a pension scheme including definitions, benefits, trustee duties, and winding up procedures. 3) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, this document serves a different regulatory purpose (pension scheme documentation) than a terms of business document which would outline the general relationship between the regulated entity and its consumers. 4) The document is governed primarily by pension legislation (Pensions Act 1990) and tax legislation (TCA), rather than consumer protection regulations. 5) The document's purpose is to establish and govern a specific pension scheme rather than set out general terms of business between a regulated entity and consumers.",
