The document clearly states that the benefits payable under the scheme will be provided by means of assurances issued by AIB life. The document also refers to AIB life as the 'Life Office' throughout, including in the definitions section where it explicitly defines 'Life Office' as 'AIB life or where AIB life agrees in writing, any other life office authorised to carry on life assurance business in Ireland.' This indicates that AIB life is the underwriter of the insurance policy.",
