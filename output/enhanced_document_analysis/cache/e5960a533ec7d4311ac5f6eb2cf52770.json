  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The regulation specifically addresses insurance undertakings appointing third parties for restitution work in claims settlement. The document is instead a set of pension scheme rules that outline the structure, benefits, and administration of a company pension life cover scheme. 2) While the document does mention AIB life as providing insurance policies, it does not contain any provisions about claims settlement processes or third-party appointments for restitution work. 3) The document's scope is limited to defining the scheme rules, trustee duties, eligibility, and benefit calculations for a pension life cover scheme. It does not cover operational aspects of claims handling or settlement procedures that would fall under this specific consumer protection regulation. 4) The regulation is specifically about providing information to claimants about third-party restitution work, which is not a topic addressed anywhere in these scheme rules.",
