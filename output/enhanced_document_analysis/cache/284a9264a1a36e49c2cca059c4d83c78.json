  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation clearly applies to the pension life cover scheme document for several reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page). 2) The document outlines a financial product (pension life cover) that directly impacts customer interests and benefits. 3) The document contains multiple elements that align with the regulation's requirements, including: detailed rules for protecting beneficiaries' interests, clear definitions and explanations of terms, specific procedures for benefit payments, trustee duties to act in beneficiaries' interests, and complaint/contact procedures. The document demonstrates compliance with regulation 5's requirements by: ensuring customer interests are protected through clear policy terms, providing transparent information about the product design and delivery, establishing fair procedures for benefit distribution, and including clear contact information for resolving issues. The document's structure and content show it was designed with customer protection in mind, which is a core requirement of the regulation.",
