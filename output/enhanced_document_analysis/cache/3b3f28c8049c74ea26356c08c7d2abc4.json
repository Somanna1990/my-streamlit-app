  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for the following reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of a pension death benefit scheme. It does not deal with the payment of fees, commissions, or rewards to intermediaries or other parties. 2) The document specifically states it is about providing benefits to dependants in the event of a member's death before retirement age through a trust structure. 3) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, the document does not contain any provisions about paying commissions or fees to third parties for regulated activities. 4) The financial arrangements described in the document are limited to premium payments from employers and benefit payments to beneficiaries, not intermediary compensation. 5) The regulation in question (Section 48, Regulation 20) specifically governs who can receive fees/commissions for providing regulated activities, which is not a subject matter covered in these scheme rules.",
