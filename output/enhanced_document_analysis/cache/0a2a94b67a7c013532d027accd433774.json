  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the pension life cover scheme document for several reasons: 1) The document is issued by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page). 2) The document describes a regulated financial product (pension life cover scheme) that involves fees, premiums and benefits being paid between multiple parties (employer, trustee, life office, and beneficiaries). 3) Section 2.3 specifically discusses premiums paid by employers, and Section 3 covers various benefits payable to dependants. 4) The document establishes a regulated financial relationship between AIB life (regulated entity), the employer/trustee, and the ultimate consumers (member and dependants). The regulation's requirements around fees, commissions and rewards that don't impair the duty to act honestly, fairly and professionally are directly relevant to how this pension scheme must be operated. 5) The document's content around trustee duties (Section 4) and scheme benefits (Section 3) must comply with these regulatory requirements regarding conflicts of interest and suitability.",
