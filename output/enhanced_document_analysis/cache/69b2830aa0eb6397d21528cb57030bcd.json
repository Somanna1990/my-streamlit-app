  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation requires regulated entities to retain records of consumer transactions for 6 years after the transaction is discontinued or completed, and to retain records provided to consumers for 6 years after ceasing to provide financial services to the consumer. The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document from AIB life, which is a regulated financial service provider. However, the document does not contain any information about record retention periods or policies, which is required under Regulation 117 of the Consumer Protection Regulations 2025.",

  "gap_description": "The document does not include any information about the retention of records related to consumer transactions or other records provided to consumers. There is no mention of the required 6-year retention period after transactions are discontinued or completed, nor the 6-year retention period after ceasing to provide financial services to consumers. Additionally, there is no information about the 12-month retention period for records where a consumer has requested or been offered a financial service but has not been provided with it.",
  "gap_recommendations": "The document should be updated to include a specific section on record retention that clearly states: (1) Records detailing consumer transactions will be retained for 6 years after the date the transaction is discontinued or completed; (2) Other records provided to consumers will be retained for 6 years from the date AIB life ceased to provide any financial service to the consumer; (3) Where a consumer has requested or been offered a financial service but has not received it, records will be retained for 12 months subject to consumer consent; (4) Clarify the consumer's right to withhold or withdraw consent for record retention in cases where services were not provided. This information could be included in Section 4 (Trustee Duties and Powers) or as a new dedicated section.",
