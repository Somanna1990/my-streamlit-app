  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically deals with 'compound annual rate', 'Key Features Documents', PRSAs and investment product target markets, while the document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that provides death benefits only. 2) The document describes an occupational pension scheme that provides only death-in-service benefits, not an investment or savings product where compound interest rates would be relevant. 3) The scheme described is established under the Pensions Act 1990 as a retirement benefits scheme under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA, not as a PRSA. 4) The document outlines trustee duties, scheme benefits, and operational rules rather than consumer protection requirements around interest rates or investment suitability. The scheme's purpose is solely to provide death benefits to dependants if the member dies before retirement age, making the consumer protection regulations around investment products and compound rates irrelevant to this type of product.",
