  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the pension life cover scheme document for several reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, making it a regulated entity subject to these regulations. 2) The document deals with pension and life cover products provided to consumers who are natural persons. 3) The scheme involves trustees and beneficiaries who may be in vulnerable circumstances, particularly in cases of death claims where dependants need to interact with the scheme. 4) The document includes sections about contacting AIB life and providing assistance to scheme members and beneficiaries, which aligns with the regulation's requirement to provide reasonable assistance. 5) Section 3.1 specifically mentions that 'dependants will be required to provide any evidence and information the trustee may require,' which could involve vulnerable individuals needing assistance during the claims process. The document should therefore incorporate processes to assist vulnerable consumers in accordance with this regulation.",
