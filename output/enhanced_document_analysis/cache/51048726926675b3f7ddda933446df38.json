  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of an executive pension life cover scheme, rather than a document related to charges or fees. 2) While section 2.3 mentions premiums, these are explicitly stated to be paid by the employer, not the consumer/member. 3) The document is establishing the legal framework and rules of the pension scheme itself rather than providing a financial service that would require a breakdown of charges to a consumer. 4) The scheme member is not responsible for any charges - the document clearly states that 'The employer will pay all premiums under any policy effected under the rules.' Therefore, since there are no direct charges to the consumer/member that would require disclosure under Regulation 66, this regulation is not applicable to this document.",
