  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (307) specifically deals with the interpretation of terms related to consumer insurance contracts, personal injury claims, and direct settlement methods. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. The document is not a consumer insurance contract - it is an occupational pension scheme document governed by the Pensions Act 1990 and Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The document explicitly states it is an 'occupational pension scheme' established for company pensions, with the employer as trustee and AIB Life as the registered administrator. The terms being defined in Regulation 307 (Act of 2019, method of direct settlement, Personal Injuries Resolution Board) have no relevance to the administration or operation of this type of pension scheme. Additionally, the document's legal framework is clearly established under pension legislation rather than consumer protection or insurance contract law.",
