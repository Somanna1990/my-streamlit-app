  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (Section 74) specifically applies to advertisements that refer to or relate to regulated activities available to consumers. The document provided is a comprehensive scheme rules document for an Executive Pension Life Cover product, not an advertisement. The document is a formal legal/contractual document that outlines definitions, operational rules, trustee duties, scheme benefits, and administrative procedures for a company pension scheme. It contains no promotional or advertising content. While the underlying pension product is a regulated activity, this particular document serves as the governing rules and terms rather than any form of advertisement or promotional material. Therefore, this specific regulation about advertisements does not apply to this type of document.",
