  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland ('Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland'). 2) The document includes a specific contact section (Section 6) that provides methods for customers to contact AIB life, which aligns with the requirement for regulated entities to have procedures for managing communications with customers. 3) The document is a formal policy document governing pension life cover schemes, which is a regulated financial product requiring consumer protection measures. 4) While the document doesn't explicitly detail complaint handling procedures, Section 6 provides multiple channels for customer contact (postal address, email, phone, mobile app) which would be used for complaints, and as a regulated entity, AIB life would be required to follow the complaint handling procedures specified in Regulation 105. The fact that this is a regulated financial product from a Central Bank regulated entity means the consumer protection regulations, including complaint handling procedures, must apply.",
