  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension life cover scheme rules document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically addresses home insurance and motor insurance policies and their related additional financial services at renewal, while this document outlines rules for an executive pension life cover scheme. 2) The document describes a standalone pension product rather than an additional financial service attached to home/motor insurance. 3) The scheme rules document focuses on providing death benefits for dependants before retirement age through an occupational pension scheme structure, which falls under different regulatory frameworks (primarily the Pensions Act and TCA). 4) The pricing and renewal mechanisms described in the document are fundamentally different from those addressed in the regulation, being based on fixed premiums unless indexation applies, rather than the consumer pricing protections for insurance renewals that the regulation addresses. 5) The document shows this is regulated by the Pensions Authority and Revenue Commissioners rather than falling under the scope of this specific CPC regulation.",
