  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The regulation specifically pertains to investment products and the requirement to update information provided to intermediaries. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that provides death benefits only - it is not an investment product. This is explicitly stated in the document: 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) The document describes a direct relationship between AIB Life, the employer/trustee, and the member - there is no intermediary involvement mentioned that would trigger the regulation's requirements about updating intermediary information. 3) The scheme rules document is a governance document that outlines the operation and administration of a death benefit scheme, rather than an investment product information document that would fall under the scope of Regulation 405's intermediary update requirements.",
