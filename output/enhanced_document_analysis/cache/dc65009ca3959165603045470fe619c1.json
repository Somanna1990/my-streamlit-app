  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically addresses insurance renewal pricing, while the document is about a pension life cover scheme that provides death benefits through an occupational pension scheme. 2) The document outlines scheme rules for company pensions and does not contain any provisions about renewal pricing or consumer insurance policies. 3) The scheme described is an occupational pension arrangement between an employer and trustees, not a direct consumer insurance product. 4) The premium structure described in section 2.3 states that 'The employer will pay all premiums' and that the premium is generally fixed unless specific changes are made - this is fundamentally different from the consumer insurance renewal pricing that the regulation aims to govern. 5) The document describes a B2B product (employer to trustee) rather than a B2C insurance product that would fall under consumer protection regulations.",
