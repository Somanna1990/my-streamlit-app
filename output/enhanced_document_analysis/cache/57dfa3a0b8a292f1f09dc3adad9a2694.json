  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a set of scheme rules that govern the operation of an occupational pension scheme, specifically focused on providing death benefits - it is not a statement of suitability or financial advice document. 2) The document's purpose is to establish the legal framework, definitions, and operational rules of the pension scheme rather than to provide personalized financial recommendations to consumers. 3) The regulation in question (Regulation 18) specifically requires preparation of statements of suitability prior to providing financial services, which is a separate document/process from scheme rules. 4) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office provider, this document serves as the constitutional document of the pension scheme rather than a pre-sale suitability assessment. Any suitability requirements would apply to the sales process of the pension scheme, not to the scheme rules themselves. 5) The document explicitly states it is a rules document ('Scheme Rules for Company Pensions') and contains standard pension scheme provisions like definitions, trustee powers, and scheme operation details rather than personalized suitability assessments.",
