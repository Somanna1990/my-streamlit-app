  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The regulation specifically addresses advertisements and qualifying criteria related to fixed prices or savings amounts in advertisements. The document is a comprehensive scheme rules document, not an advertisement. 2) The document is a legal/contractual document that outlines the rules, definitions, and operational procedures of a pension life cover scheme. It does not contain any advertising content or promotional material about fixed prices or savings. 3) While the document does contain information about benefits, premiums, and maximum amounts, these are presented as contractual terms and regulatory requirements rather than advertising claims. 4) The document's purpose is to serve as a reference for scheme rules and governance, not to promote or advertise the financial product. Therefore, the advertising-specific requirements outlined in Regulation 81 are not applicable to this type of document.",
