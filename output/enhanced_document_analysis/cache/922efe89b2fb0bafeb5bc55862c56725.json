  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operational framework, definitions, and procedures for a company pension life cover scheme. It does not contain any advertisements, recommendations, or commendations that would fall under Regulation 85's scope. 2) The document is purely informational and procedural in nature, detailing how the scheme works, trustee duties, benefits structure, and administrative procedures. 3) While the document mentions AIB life as the provider, it does not include any promotional content, testimonials, or recommendations that would need to comply with the advertising requirements specified in Regulation 85. The document appears to be a standard policy rules document rather than marketing or promotional material.",
