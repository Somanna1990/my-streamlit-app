  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension life cover scheme rules document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pure protection product (life cover scheme) rather than an investment product - it is explicitly stated that 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) The scheme does not have any investment component or accumulation of value - it only pays out a death benefit if the member dies while the policy is in force. 3) The regulation specifically applies to investment products and periodic suitability assessments for investment recommendations, while this document outlines rules for a pure protection insurance product. 4) The document makes no mention of investment decisions, investment management, or periodic reviews of investment suitability as it is not relevant to this type of protection-only product. Therefore, the requirements around periodic suitability assessments for investment products under Regulation 374 are not applicable to this type of life cover scheme.",
