  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (316) specifically deals with 'closed books' for insurance policies, particularly home and motor insurance products. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the rules and operation of an occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. The key reasons this regulation does not apply are: 1) The document describes a pension product, not a home or motor insurance product which are the specific focus of the regulation, 2) The document outlines a new scheme rules document (version 1 from 2023) rather than a closed book product, 3) The product is administered by AIB life as a pension trustee product under the Pensions Act and TCA regulations, not as a general insurance product. The document falls under pension regulations rather than insurance product regulations regarding closed books.",

  "regulation_text": "316. (1) Where a consumer's insurance policy is in a closed book, the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary shall determine the consumer's equivalent first renewal price in accordance with this Regulation. (2) The insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary shall identify from the home insurance and motor insurance products that it currently actively markets or distributes, whether it has one or more home insurance or motor insurance product that is a close matched product. (3) Where the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary no longer actively markets or distributes any home insurance or motor insurance product which is a close matched product but it is part of a group which does actively market or distribute home insur ance or motor insurance products, the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary shall, where possible, identify a close matched product from those products actively marketed or distributed by the insurance undertaking's or insurance intermediary' s group. (4) Where there is more than one product which is a close matched product, the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary shall either - (a) select the close matched product which is the most similar to the consumer's existing insurance policy, or (b) where it is not possible to identify the most similar close matched product, select the close matched product which will lead to the most favourable pricing outcome for consumers who hold an insurance policy in the closed book. (5) (a) Where a close matched product is identified or selected, the equivalent first renewal price for a consumer in the relevant book shall be the equivalent first renewal price the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary would offer for the close matched product, subject to any permitted adjustments set out in subparagraph (b) and, where appropriate, the assumptions set out at Regulations 315(2) and 315(3). (b) The permitted adjustments are those which fairly and proportionately reflect the difference in costs for the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary arising from differences between the cost to serve or cover or benefits (including any compulso ry excess) provided by the insurance policies in the closed book and the close matched product. (6) Where an insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary is unable to generate an equivalent first renewal price or identify a product which is a close matched product because an insurance policy - (a) is not part of an insurance undertaking's or insurance intermediary's or its group's standard insurance policy offering, (b) falls outside the insurance undertaking's or insurance intermediary's or its group's underwriting policies, or (c) although part of its group's standard policy offering, is not an insurance policy in respect of which the insurance undertaking's or the insurance intermediary's group may share the relevant pricing information, the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary shall set the subsequent renewal price in accordance with Regulation 321.",
