  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation requires that any document referring to both regulated and unregulated activities must clearly identify which activities are regulated and which are unregulated. The document appears to be describing a pension life cover scheme which is likely a regulated financial product, but it does not clearly state which aspects are regulated activities and which (if any) are unregulated activities. Additionally, the document does not include the required warning statement for unregulated activities if any are present. The document mentions AIB life as the provider but does not clarify the regulatory status of all services described.",
  "compliance_evidence": "",
  "gap_description": "The document fails to: 1) Clearly identify which activities described are regulated and which are unregulated; 2) Bring to the consumer's attention any regulatory protections that apply to regulated activities but not to unregulated activities; 3) Include the mandatory warning statement required by Regulation 73(1)(c) if any unregulated activities are being described.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1) Add clear identification of which activities described in the document are regulated and which are unregulated; 2) Include explicit information about regulatory protections that apply to regulated activities but not to unregulated activities; 3) If any unregulated activities are described, add the mandatory warning statement: 'Warning: The provision of this service does not require licensing, registration or authorisation by the Central Bank of Ireland, and as a result is not covered by Central Bank of Ireland rules designed to protect consumers or by a statutory compensation scheme.'",
