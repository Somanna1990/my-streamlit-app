  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation, benefits, and administration of a company pension scheme - it is not a schedule of fees and charges. 2) While the document mentions AIB life as an administrator and service provider, this specific document's purpose is to establish and govern the rules of a pension scheme, not to display fees and charges to consumers. 3) The document is an internal governance document rather than a public-facing fee schedule that would need to be displayed in offices or on websites. 4) Throughout the entire document, there is no section dedicated to fees or charges that would need to be publicly displayed - the only financial mentions are related to benefits calculations and premium payments. While AIB life as a regulated entity would need to comply with this regulation in other contexts, this particular document is not subject to the requirement to display fees and charges.",
