  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document outlines a financial product (Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme) provided by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. 2) The document contains multiple potential conflict of interest scenarios, particularly in Section 4.5 where it states 'No decision of the trustee will be invalidated by reason of the trustee having a direct or personal interest in the result of any such decision.' 3) The document involves trustees who may be the employer themselves or independent trustees, creating potential conflicts between their roles as employer and trustee. 4) The scheme involves management of benefits and payments that could affect consumers (members and their dependants), requiring careful management of any conflicts. 5) The document specifically deals with financial services provided to consumers, making it subject to consumer protection regulations. The regulation's requirements for disclosure and management of conflicts directly relate to the trustee-member relationship described in this document.",
