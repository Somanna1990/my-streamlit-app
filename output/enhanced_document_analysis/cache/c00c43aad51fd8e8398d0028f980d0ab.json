Regulation 16 applies because this is a financial service document from a regulated entity. The document shows some evidence of gathering consumer information, but does not fully demonstrate compliance with all aspects of Regulation 16, particularly regarding the explicit requirement to gather and record sufficient information about the consumer prior to offering the service.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The document contains definitions and references to consumer information such as: \"Final Remuneration is the rate of remuneration payable to the member at the date of the member's death\" and \"Member (also known as the life covered in the Policy Schedule) Means an employee of the employer who is eligible for membership and is included in the scheme.\" The document also references \"the application\" which may contain consumer information: \"This will be shown in the application.\"; The employee or director to be nominated for inclusion in the scheme shall be selected by the employer at commencement of the scheme.

  "gap_description": "The document does not explicitly outline the process for gathering and recording consumer information as required by Regulation 16. Specifically, it lacks clear provisions for gathering information on the consumer's needs and objectives, personal circumstances, financial situation, attitude to risk, and sustainability preferences. There is no mention of a process to ensure the consumer certifies the accuracy of information provided. The document also does not address what happens if a consumer refuses to provide requested information.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Include a specific section detailing the information gathering process that aligns with Regulation 16 requirements.\n2. Develop a standardized form or questionnaire that captures all required consumer information (needs, objectives, personal circumstances, financial situation, attitude to risk, sustainability preferences).\n3. Add provisions requiring consumers to certify the accuracy of information provided.\n4. Include procedures for handling situations where consumers refuse to provide requested information.\n5. Establish a process for regular review and updating of consumer information, particularly before providing additional services.",
