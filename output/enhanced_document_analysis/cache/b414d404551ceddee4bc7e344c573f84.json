  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of an occupational pension scheme, specifically focused on death benefits. It is not a direct consumer product sale or advisory situation that would trigger the exemptions in Regulation 19. 2) The document shows this is an employer-established trust arrangement governed by the Pensions Act and Revenue requirements, not a direct consumer financial product. 3) The scheme rules indicate this is set up by employers for employees as trustees, with AIB Life acting only as the registered administrator and policy provider - not as a regulated entity providing direct consumer advice or products. 4) The document's purpose is to establish governance rules for trustees and define scheme benefits, not to document consumer product sales or advice. The consumer protection regulation cited specifically deals with exemptions from knowing the consumer and suitability requirements in direct consumer product sales scenarios, which is not relevant to this type of pension scheme documentation.",
