  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that establishes a financial product offered by AIB Life. As a regulated financial entity, AIB Life would be subject to the Central Bank regulations regarding conflicts of interest. The document partially addresses conflicts of interest by stating that the main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for dependants and that benefits cannot be assigned (except as otherwise provided). However, the document does not explicitly address how conflicts of interest related to fees, commissions, rewards, or remuneration linked to targets are avoided, nor does it address agreements where the regulated entity receives rewards in return for directing business.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The main purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age. Except as otherwise provided in the rules, benefits cannot be assigned.; The employer will pay all premiums under any policy effected under the rules. The initial premium payable is shown on the policy schedule. The premium is a fixed amount unless an indexation or annual increase option applies to the policy, or if changes are made to the policy.; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member.; No decision of the trustee will be invalidated by reason of the trustee having a direct or personal interest in the result of any such decision or in the exercising of any such power provider that such trustee had disclosed any such interest to the other trustees (if any) and to the employer.",
  "gap_description": "The document lacks explicit provisions addressing: 1) How conflicts of interest related to fees, commission, rewards or remuneration linked to targets that may not consider a consumer's best interests are avoided; 2) How the regulated entity avoids agreements where it receives fees, commission, rewards or remuneration in the form of goods or services in return for directing business through or in the way of another person.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1) Add a specific section on conflicts of interest that explicitly addresses how AIB Life avoids conflicts related to fees, commissions, and remuneration linked to targets that might not consider consumers' best interests; 2) Include provisions that explicitly prohibit or regulate agreements where AIB Life would receive rewards in return for directing business; 3) Detail the governance procedures in place to identify, prevent and manage potential conflicts of interest; 4) Include a statement confirming compliance with Regulation 23 of the Consumer Protection Regulations 2025.",
