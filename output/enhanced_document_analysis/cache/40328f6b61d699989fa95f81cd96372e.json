  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that specifically deals with death benefits before retirement age - it is not a consumer insurance product with renewal pricing. 2) The scheme described is an occupational pension scheme governed by the Pensions Act and Revenue rules, not a consumer insurance product. 3) The document makes no mention of pricing or premium discrimination based on tenure, as it is a single-premium or regular premium company pension arrangement. 4) The regulation specifically addresses insurance undertakings and intermediaries in their dealings with consumer insurance products and renewal pricing, while this document outlines trustee rules and scheme benefits for an employer-sponsored pension death benefit arrangement. The nature of the product (occupational pension scheme) and its purpose (death benefits for dependants) places it outside the scope of this consumer protection regulation regarding insurance renewal pricing.",
