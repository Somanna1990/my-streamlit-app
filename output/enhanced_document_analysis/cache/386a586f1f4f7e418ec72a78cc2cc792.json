The document provided is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines definitions, scheme operations, and benefits. It does not contain any content related to error resolution procedures. This document is a product rules document rather than an operational procedure document for handling errors. The regulation would apply to the financial institution's (AIB Life's) error handling procedures, not to the product rules document itself.",
