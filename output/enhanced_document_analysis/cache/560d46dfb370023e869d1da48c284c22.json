  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, benefits, and administration of a death benefit pension scheme. It does not contain any provisions about employee remuneration arrangements or how employees are incentivized to sell financial products. 2) The document focuses on defining the roles of trustees, employers, and scheme administrators in managing death benefits for scheme members - it does not address how financial products are sold or recommended to consumers. 3) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, the document does not cover their internal employee compensation structures or sales practices. 4) The document's purpose is to establish governance rules for a specific type of pension scheme rather than regulate how financial products are sold to consumers. The regulation in question specifically addresses how regulated entities structure employee remuneration in relation to selling financial services, which is not within the scope of this scheme rules document.",
