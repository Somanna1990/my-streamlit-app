  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation clearly applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page of document). 2) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that constitutes a financial service product, making AIB life a regulated entity under the Central Bank Reform Act. 3) The document's content directly aligns with several requirements from the regulation, including: protecting customer interests (shown in trustee duties), providing clear information to customers (evident in the detailed definitions and explanations), and maintaining proper systems and controls (demonstrated through the governance structure described). 4) The document includes specific sections on trustee duties, scheme benefits, and customer protections that mirror the regulatory requirements for acting with due skill, care and diligence and in customers' best interests. 5) The document explicitly references regulatory compliance requirements throughout, including references to the Pensions Authority and Revenue Commissioners, showing it operates within the regulated financial services framework.",
