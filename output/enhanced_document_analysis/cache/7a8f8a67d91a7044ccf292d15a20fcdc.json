It is not related to SME lending or relevant activities as defined in the regulation. 2) The document is specifically about an insurance/pension product offered by AIB Life, not lending activities. 3) The scheme described is an occupational pension scheme governed by the Pensions Act and Revenue requirements, not SME lending regulations. 4) The document's purpose and content are focused on providing death benefits for scheme members' dependants, which falls outside the scope of SME lending activities referenced in Regulation 8. 5) The regulated entity (AIB Life) is operating as an insurance/pension provider in this context, not as a lender to SMEs.",
