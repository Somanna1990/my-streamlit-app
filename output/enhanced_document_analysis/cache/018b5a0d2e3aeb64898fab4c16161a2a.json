  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation applies because the document describes a pension life cover scheme where AIB life is providing services to the scheme. The document mentions outsourcing in section 2.1, where it states that the trustee will take out a policy with the life office (AIB life) to provide benefits. This constitutes an outsourced activity where a regulated entity (likely AIB life) employs another person to carry out activities on its behalf. However, the document only partially addresses the requirement that 'a regulated entity shall ensure that any outsourced activity complies with the requirements of these Regulations' as it doesn't explicitly state that outsourced activities will comply with all relevant regulations.",
  "compliance_evidence": "The policy will be subject to the terms and conditions provided to the trustees by the life office.; The employer will pay all premiums under any policy effected under the rules. The initial premium payable is shown on the policy schedule.; The trustee hereby appoints AIB life as registered administrator for the purposes of the Pensions Act. AIB life agrees to prepare, on behalf of the trustee, the annual pension benefit statement for the member. Annual trustee reports and audited accounts are not required for schemes where the only benefit under the scheme is a death benefit in the event that the member dies before normal retirement age. The trustee or AIB life can choose to terminate this appointment by giving at least 90 days written notice to the other party. This 90 day notice period may only be reduced where both parties agree to it, or if required by legislation.",
  "gap_description": "The document does not explicitly state that outsourced activities will comply with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Regulations. While it mentions that policies are subject to terms and conditions, it doesn't specifically address regulatory compliance for outsourced activities. The document lacks clear statements about ensuring that any outsourced activities comply with consumer protection requirements.",
  "gap_recommendations": "Add explicit language stating that any outsourced activities will comply with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Regulations. Include a specific section addressing regulatory compliance for outsourced activities. Detail the oversight mechanisms that ensure outsourced service providers adhere to consumer protection requirements. Clarify the responsibilities of all parties involved in outsourced activities regarding regulatory compliance.",
