  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation in question (Regulation 69) specifically addresses the requirement for regulated entities to notify consumers about increases and decreases in charges. After reviewing the document 'Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules', I find that this document is a set of scheme rules for a company pension life cover product. It does not contain any provisions related to notifying consumers about changes in charges. The document appears to be a foundational document that establishes the rules of the scheme rather than a communication about charges or fee changes. The document defines terms, explains how the scheme works, outlines benefits, and describes trustee duties, but does not address the notification process for charge changes that would fall under Regulation 69.",
