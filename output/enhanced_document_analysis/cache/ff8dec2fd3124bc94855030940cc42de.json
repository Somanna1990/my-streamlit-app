  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (349) specifically deals with premium rebates for insurance products and the options insurance undertakings/intermediaries must provide to consumers regarding those rebates. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. While it does discuss premiums in Section 2.3, these are employer-paid premiums for the pension scheme, not insurance premiums that would be subject to consumer rebates. The document makes no mention of premium rebates or consumer options regarding rebates. Additionally, the scheme is established as a trust-based pension arrangement governed by the Pensions Act and TCA (Taxes Consolidation Act), not as a direct consumer insurance product. The parties involved are the employer, trustees, and scheme member in their capacity as an employee, rather than as a consumer in the context of the Consumer Protection Regulations.",
