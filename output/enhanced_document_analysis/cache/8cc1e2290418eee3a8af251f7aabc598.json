  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation specifically governs the opening and operation of joint accounts between two or more consumers. The document in question is a Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document that outlines the rules and operation of an executive pension life cover scheme. The scheme described is an individual occupational pension scheme that provides death benefits for a single member's dependants - it is explicitly stated in Section 2.2 that 'The scheme is established for that one person only and that one person will always be the only member.' There are no joint account features or operations described in this document. The document deals with trust-based pension arrangements between an employer, trustee, and single member, which is fundamentally different from the joint consumer accounts that Regulation 127 is designed to govern.",
