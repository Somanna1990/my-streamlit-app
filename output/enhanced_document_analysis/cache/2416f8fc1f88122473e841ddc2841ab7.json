  "applicability": "Applies",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is for a pension life cover scheme administered by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (last page). 2) The document discusses premiums and charges in Section 2.3, stating 'The premium is a fixed amount unless an indexation or annual increase option applies to the policy, or if changes are made to the policy.' This indicates that charges can change over time. 3) The scheme involves ongoing financial charges to employers and has provisions for changes to these charges. 4) As a regulated entity providing financial services to consumers (employers and beneficiaries), AIB life would be required to comply with this regulation regarding notification of any changes to charges. The document would need to incorporate or align with these notification requirements for charge increases (30 days notice) and decreases (as soon as practicable). The regulation is directly relevant to the operational aspects of this pension scheme.",
