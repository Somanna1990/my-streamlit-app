  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that only provides death benefits before retirement age - it is not an insurance policy that covers property damage or restitution work. 2) The regulation specifically deals with certification requirements for property restoration work undertaken by insurance companies, which is completely unrelated to the pension death benefits described in this document. 3) The document makes no mention of any property damage claims, restoration work, or certification requirements. The document's sole purpose, as stated multiple times, is 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' Therefore, this specific consumer protection regulation about property restoration certification is not applicable to this type of pension scheme document.",
