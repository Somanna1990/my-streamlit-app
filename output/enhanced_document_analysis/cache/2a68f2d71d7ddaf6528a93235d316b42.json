  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of formal scheme rules governing an executive pension life cover scheme, not related to personal visits or direct consumer contact. 2) The document outlines the legal and administrative framework for trustees, employers, and scheme administrators - it does not contain any provisions about marketing or sales visits to consumers. 3) The interactions described in the document are primarily between institutional parties (employers, trustees, administrators) rather than direct consumer contact. 4) While the document does include contact information for AIB life, it is for customer service purposes rather than unsolicited visits. The regulation specifically addresses unsolicited personal visits to consumers, which is not part of the scope or content of these pension scheme rules.",
