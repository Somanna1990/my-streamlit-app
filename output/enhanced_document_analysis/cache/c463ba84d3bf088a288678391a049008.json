  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a scheme rules document that outlines the terms and operation of a pension life cover scheme - it is not itself a policy or procedure document that staff need to reference to perform their duties. 2) The document is meant for trustees, employers and scheme members rather than being an internal procedural document for employees of the regulated entity (AIB Life). 3) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, this document does not contain their internal policies and procedures that would fall under the scope of regulation 120 which specifically requires policies/procedures to be accessible to employees. This is instead a customer-facing document that establishes the legal framework and rules of the pension scheme itself. The regulation in question specifically pertains to internal policies and procedures that employees need access to for performing their duties, not scheme documentation provided to customers.",
