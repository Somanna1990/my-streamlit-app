  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation in question (Regulation 22 regarding conflicts of interest policy) does not apply to this document. The document is a set of pension life cover scheme rules that outlines the structure, definitions, and operation of a pension scheme designed to provide benefits for a member's dependants in case of death before retirement. The document does not address conflicts of interest policies, which would be covered in separate governance documentation. This document is focused on defining the scheme rules rather than the regulated entity's internal policies and procedures for managing conflicts of interest. The document appears to be a product documentation rather than an internal policy document of a regulated entity.",
