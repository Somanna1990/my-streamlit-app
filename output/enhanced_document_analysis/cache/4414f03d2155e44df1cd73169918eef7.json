However, it lacks specific information about cancellation or withdrawal rights as required by Regulation 59(2).",

  "gap_description": "The document does not explicitly state whether there is a right to cancel or withdraw from the contract, nor does it provide the terms that would apply to such a right or instructions on how to exercise it, as required by Regulation 59(2)(a) and (b). Additionally, while the document appears to be provided in a durable medium (PDF format), there is no explicit confirmation that this information was provided to the consumer prior to offering the service as required by Regulation 59(1) and (3).",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Add a specific section that clearly states whether there is a right to cancel or withdraw from the contract. 2. If such a right exists, include the terms that apply to that right, including the period during which the right must be exercised, and provide clear instructions on how the consumer can exercise that right. 3. Ensure that this document is provided to consumers before they enter into the contract, and maintain records of this provision. 4. Consider adding a statement confirming that this information is being provided in accordance with regulatory requirements prior to the consumer entering into the contract.",
