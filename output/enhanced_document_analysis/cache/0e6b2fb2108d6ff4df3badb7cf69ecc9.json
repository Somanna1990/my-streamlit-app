  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the pension life cover scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The regulation specifically pertains to loss adjustors and expert appraisers in the context of processing insurance claims, while this document is about pension scheme rules for death benefits. 2) The document outlines the rules and administration of a pension scheme, not claims processing procedures. 3) While the document does discuss death benefit claims, it does not mention or involve loss adjustors or expert appraisers in the claims process. Instead, it specifies that claims are handled directly between the trustee, the life office (AIB life), and the beneficiaries. 4) The document's claims process is governed by pension legislation (Pensions Act 1990) and tax law (TCA), not insurance claims regulations. The scheme is structured as a pension product rather than an insurance product, despite having a life cover component.",
