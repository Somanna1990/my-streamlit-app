  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (110) specifically governs the conditions under which regulated entities can initiate telephone calls with potential or former customers. The document provided is a Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document that outlines the rules, definitions, and operations of a company pension scheme. The document does not contain any content related to telephone contact procedures or customer communication protocols. While the document does include contact information in Section 6, this is for inbound contact from customers to AIB life, not outbound telephone calls from AIB to potential or former customers. The document's scope is limited to defining the structure, benefits, and administration of the pension scheme, making Regulation 110 regarding telephone contact protocols irrelevant to this particular document.",
