  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme provided by AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (as noted at the end of the document). 2) The scheme constitutes a financial service being provided to customers in Ireland, making AIB life a 'regulated entity' under the regulation's definition. 3) The document outlines a financial product/service being offered to employers and their employees, who would fall under the regulation's definition of 'customers' and potentially 'consumers' depending on the employer's size and turnover. 4) The document contains provisions for customer protection, trustee duties, and scheme administration that would need to comply with the Central Bank's standards for business. The document's detailed sections on scheme benefits, trustee duties, and customer contact information indicate it is subject to regulatory oversight under Section 17A of the Central Bank Reform Act.",
