  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure and operation of a pension death benefit scheme - it is not related to premium rebates or refunds. 2) While the document does mention refunds in section 2.4, this is specifically about refunding excess proceeds to employers when benefits exceed maximum permitted amounts, which is different from consumer premium rebates. 3) The scheme described is an occupational pension scheme governed by the Pensions Act and Revenue requirements, not a consumer insurance product. 4) The relationship described in the document is between employers, trustees, and scheme members in an occupational pension context, not a direct consumer-insurer relationship that would fall under the consumer protection regulation about premium rebates. 5) The document contains no provisions or procedures related to premium rebates to consumers, which is the specific focus of Regulation 351.",
