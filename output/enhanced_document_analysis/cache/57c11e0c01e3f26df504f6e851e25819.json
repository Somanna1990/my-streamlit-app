  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of pension scheme rules that defines the structure, benefits, and operation of a pension life cover scheme - it is not announcing changes to services. 2) The document is a foundational document (version 001) establishing the scheme rules rather than a notice of changes to existing services. 3) While section 4.2 of the document discusses the possibility of future alterations to the scheme rules, it does not constitute an actual notice of changes that would trigger this regulation. 4) The document's purpose is to establish the baseline rules and framework for the pension scheme, not to notify consumers of amendments to services. The regulation in question specifically pertains to notices about changes to the range of services provided by regulated entities, which is not the purpose or content of this document.",
