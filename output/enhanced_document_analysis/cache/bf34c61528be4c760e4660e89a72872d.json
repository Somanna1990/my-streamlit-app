  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several reasons: 1) The document is a set of pension scheme rules that governs how a company pension life cover scheme operates, not a document about intermediary appointments or business requirements. 2) The document shows this is a direct product from AIB Life (as evidenced by the footer showing Saol Assurance d.a.c. trading as AIB Life), not an intermediary arrangement. 3) The scheme rules detail a direct relationship between the employer, trustee, and AIB Life as the life office, with no mention of intermediaries being involved in the distribution. 4) The regulation specifically applies to regulated entities requiring business levels from intermediaries, which is not relevant to these pension scheme rules that establish the legal framework for providing death benefits to employees.",
