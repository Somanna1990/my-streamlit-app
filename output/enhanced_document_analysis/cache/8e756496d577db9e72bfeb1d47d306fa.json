  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation specifically deals with premium rebates from insurance undertakings to consumers, requiring them to be provided within specific timeframes. The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. While the document does mention premiums in section 2.3, these are premiums paid by the employer to maintain the policy, not consumer premiums that might be subject to rebates. The scheme is structured as a trust arrangement between an employer and trustees for the benefit of employees, rather than a direct consumer insurance product. Additionally, the document makes no mention of premium rebates or refunds to consumers. The only mention of refunds is in section 2.4 regarding 'refund of excess proceeds' to the employer if benefits exceed maximum permitted amounts, which is different from the consumer premium rebates covered by the regulation.",
