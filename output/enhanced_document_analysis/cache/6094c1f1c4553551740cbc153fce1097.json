  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of a specific pension scheme, not an intermediary disclosure document. 2) The document shows this is a direct product from AIB Life (Saol Assurance d.a.c.) rather than an intermediary service. 3) The document does not contain any content about market analysis or product producer selection, which would be required if it fell under this regulation. 4) The document is focused on defining the rules, benefits, and trustee responsibilities for a specific pension scheme rather than addressing intermediary services or market comparisons. The regulation specifically targets intermediaries who need to disclose which product producers they consider, which is not relevant to this type of scheme rules document.",
