  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operational and governance framework of a company pension life cover scheme. It does not contain consumer warning statements that would fall under the scope of the regulation. 2) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, this document is primarily a legal/administrative document establishing scheme rules rather than a consumer-facing advertisement or information document. 3) The document's purpose is to define the terms, conditions, and operation of the pension scheme for trustees and employers rather than serve as a consumer communication. 4) Any warning statements that might be required under CPC regulations would appear in separate consumer-facing documents like policy documents, marketing materials, or benefit statements, not in the scheme rules document. 5) The document appears to be governed primarily by pension legislation (Pensions Act 1990) and tax legislation (TCA) rather than consumer protection regulations.",
