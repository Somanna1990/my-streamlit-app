  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation in question (Section 48, Regulation 77) specifically applies to 'advertisements' by regulated entities. The document provided is a pension scheme rules document, not an advertisement. The document is titled 'Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme rules for company pensions' and contains definitions, explanations of how the scheme works, scheme benefits, trustee duties and powers, and information about winding up the scheme. It is an informational/contractual document that outlines the rules and operations of a pension scheme rather than promotional material designed to advertise a financial service to consumers. Since this document is not an advertisement, Regulation 77 regarding standards for advertisements does not apply to it.",
