  "compliance_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document because the document is a set of pension scheme rules for a life cover policy, not a claims handling procedure document. Regulation 364 specifically addresses how insurance undertakings must handle claims decisions, including timeframes for informing claimants, content of communications, and record-keeping requirements. The document provided is a scheme rules document that outlines definitions, how the scheme works, scheme benefits, trustee duties, and winding up procedures for a pension life cover scheme. It does not contain any procedures or policies related to claims handling, decision-making on claims, or communication with claimants about claim outcomes.",
