  "reason": "This document is relevant for CPC regulation comparison as it contains several key elements that intersect with consumer protection requirements: 1) It establishes governance structures through trustee duties and oversight, 2) It defines how benefits are provided to customers (members) and their dependants, 3) It includes specific definitions and rules about customer eligibility and treatment, 4) It outlines compliance with regulatory requirements (referencing Tax Acts and Pensions Act), and 5) It describes operational procedures that affect customer outcomes. While primarily focused on pension scheme rules, the governance and customer treatment aspects make it relevant for CPC compliance review.",
