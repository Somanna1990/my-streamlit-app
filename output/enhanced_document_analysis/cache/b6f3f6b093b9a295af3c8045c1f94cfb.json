  "applicability": "Applies",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation clearly applies to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document from AIB life, which is explicitly stated to be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (as noted at the bottom of the document). 2) The document contains complex financial and legal information that falls under the scope of Regulation 9's requirements for effective customer communication. 3) The document demonstrates attempts to comply with the regulation through its structure and content: it includes clear definitions, uses a logical organization with numbered sections, attempts to explain technical concepts, and includes a dedicated 'Contacting Us' section. However, there are areas where the document could better align with Regulation 9's requirements, particularly around avoiding technical terms and ensuring all information is presented in plain language. The document contains numerous technical pension and legal terms that, while defined, could be simplified for better customer understanding. The regulation's requirements for clear, accurate, and plain language communication are directly relevant to this type of financial services document that explains pension scheme rules to customers.",
