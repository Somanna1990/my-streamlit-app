  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of a company pension life cover scheme, not a communication about intermediary status. 2) The document clearly states it is from 'AIB life' (Saol Assurance d.a.c.) acting as the product producer/life office, not as an intermediary. 3) The document's purpose is to establish and govern the rules of a pension scheme, not to disclose tied status of an intermediary. 4) While AIB life is mentioned as the provider, this document is not focused on the distribution relationship or intermediary status, but rather on the actual pension scheme rules and operation. The regulation in question specifically applies to intermediaries disclosing their tied status to consumers, which is not the purpose or content of this document.",
