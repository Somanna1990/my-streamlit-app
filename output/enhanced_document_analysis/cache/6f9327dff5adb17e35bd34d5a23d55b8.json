  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document describes a pension life cover scheme that provides death benefits before retirement age - it is not a renewable insurance policy. 2) The scheme rules explicitly state this is a one-time setup for a single member that continues until certain termination events (like death or winding up) rather than having periodic renewals. 3) The document makes no mention of automatic renewal provisions or processes. 4) This is a pension scheme document governed primarily by the Pensions Act and TCA (Taxes Consolidation Act), not a standard insurance policy. 5) The regulation specifically applies to insurance policies with duration less than 10 months, while this pension scheme is designed as a long-term arrangement until normal retirement age (between 60-70 years old). The fundamental nature of this product as a pension scheme rather than a renewable insurance policy places it outside the scope of this specific consumer protection regulation regarding automatic renewals.",

(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply where Regulation 5(1)(b) of the Non -Life Insurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2007 applies.",
