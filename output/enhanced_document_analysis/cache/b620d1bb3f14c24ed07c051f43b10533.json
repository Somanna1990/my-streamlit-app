  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the provided pension scheme rules document for several key reasons: 1) The regulation specifically addresses claim settlement offers made by insurance undertakings to claimants, while this document is a pension scheme rules document that outlines the structure and operation of an executive pension life cover scheme. 2) While the document does mention death benefit claims, it does not contain any procedures or policies about how claim settlement amounts are calculated or offered - it only defines the maximum allowable benefits under Revenue rules. 3) The document is primarily focused on establishing the scheme's structure, trustee duties, and benefit limits rather than claims handling procedures. 4) The claims-related content in the document is limited to basic eligibility verification and does not address settlement offer calculations or procedures. 5) The document indicates that any claims would be handled by AIB Life as the life office, and those procedures would be covered in separate policy documentation, not these scheme rules.",
