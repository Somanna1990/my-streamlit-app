  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a direct pension product from AIB Life, not a commission arrangement between a product producer and intermediary. 2) The document explicitly states that AIB Life provides the product directly, with no mention of intermediary distribution channels or commission structures. 3) The scheme is established directly between the employer, trustee, and AIB Life as the life office/product provider. 4) The document focuses on the rules, benefits, and administration of the pension scheme rather than distribution or compensation arrangements. 5) While AIB Life is mentioned as the product provider, there is no evidence of intermediary involvement or commission-based distribution that would trigger the applicability of this regulation.",
