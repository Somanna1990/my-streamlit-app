  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation about bundling does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a standalone death benefit pension scheme. There is no evidence of bundling of products or services - it describes a single product/scheme. 2) The document clearly states 'The main and only purpose of the scheme is to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' This indicates it is a standalone product rather than a bundled offering. 3) The document contains no references to combining this scheme with other products or services, nor any pricing/cost information that would suggest bundling. 4) The scheme is established as a distinct pension arrangement under specific pension and tax legislation, operating independently of other financial products.",
