  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation and governance of an occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. It is not an insurance policy application document or process. 2) While the document discusses life cover, it is structured as an occupational pension scheme under the Pensions Act rather than a direct insurance policy. 3) The regulation specifically addresses disclosure obligations during the insurance policy application process and notifications that must be given to consumers applying for insurance. This document instead contains scheme rules for an employer-established pension arrangement. 4) The document's primary audience is trustees and employers rather than individual consumers making insurance applications. 5) The disclosure obligations outlined in Regulation 332 are specific to direct insurance relationships with consumers, while this document governs a trust-based pension arrangement where the trustee, not the individual member, holds the policy.",
