  "compliance_reasoning": "The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that establishes a scheme where a potential conflict of interest exists - the employer can be appointed as the trustee (Section 2.1.a). This creates a conflict between the employer's interests and the member's dependants' interests. The regulation requires that when conflicts of interest arise and cannot be avoided, they must be disclosed to consumers, acknowledged by consumers, and steps must be taken to manage the conflict. The document does not contain provisions for disclosing this conflict to members, obtaining acknowledgment, or outlining steps to manage this conflict.",
  "compliance_evidence": "Section 2.1.a states: 'If the employer is appointed as the trustee On or after the start date of the scheme, the trustee will take out a policy with the life office and may, at a later date, change that policy or take out a further policy or policies with the life office for the benefit of the member's dependants.'",
  "gap_description": "The document fails to meet the requirements of Regulation 24(3) as it does not: (a) provide for full and transparent disclosure of the conflict in writing when the employer acts as trustee, (b) require consumer acknowledgment of understanding the conflict, or (c) outline steps to manage the conflict and minimize its impact on consumers. The document merely states the employer can be the trustee without addressing the inherent conflict this creates.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1. Add a section specifically addressing conflicts of interest, particularly when the employer acts as trustee. 2. Include a requirement for written disclosure of this conflict to scheme members. 3. Add a provision requiring member acknowledgment of the conflict on paper or another durable medium. 4. Detail specific steps that will be taken to manage the conflict and protect members' interests, such as independent oversight or specific decision-making protocols. 5. Consider recommending independent trustees as the default option rather than employers.",

(1) This Regulation does not apply to conflicts of interest that are the subject of Regulation 23 on the basis that those conflicts are required to be avoided pursuant to that Regulation and there are no circumstances in which such conflicts are permitted to b e managed pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3). (2) Where a conflict of interest arises with respect to a consumer and cannot be reasonably avoided, a regulated entity shall - (a) disclose the nature and source of the conflict of interest to the consumer, and (b) ensure that the conflict does not result in any damage to the interests of that consumer. (3) For the purposes of this Regulation, a regulated entity may not provide a regulated activity to a consumer if a conflict arises directly or indirectly unless - (a) the regulated entity has fully and transparently disclosed the existence and details of the conflict in writing, (b) the consumer has acknowledged, on paper or on another durable medium, that he or she understands the conflict and wishes to proceed, and (c) the regulated entity has taken all steps within its control to appropriately manage the conflict and minimise the impact of the conflict on the consumer.",
