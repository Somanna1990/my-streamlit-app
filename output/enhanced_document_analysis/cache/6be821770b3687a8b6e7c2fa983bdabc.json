  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation applies to the pension life cover scheme document for several reasons: 1) The document describes an insurance product provided by AIB life, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (stated in the document footer). 2) The document outlines a scheme that provides death benefit claims for dependants, making it subject to claims processing requirements. 3) Section 3.1 specifically discusses claims processing, stating 'If a member dies in service and a valid claim is made against the policy, the dependants will be required to provide any evidence and information the trustee may require.' The regulation's requirements about claim decisions, documentation, and communication would directly apply to how AIB life must handle these death benefit claims. 4) The document establishes a contractual framework where claims will be made and processed, making the regulation's requirements for claim decision timing, communication, and record-keeping directly relevant to this product's operation.",
