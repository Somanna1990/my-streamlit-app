  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is about an Executive Pension Life Cover Scheme, which is an occupational pension scheme governed by the Pensions Act 1990, not a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA). 2) The document explicitly states it is 'an occupational pension scheme for the purposes of the Pensions Act' and is established as 'a retirement benefits scheme as defined by Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA.' 3) The scheme's sole purpose is to provide death benefits for dependants if the member dies before retirement age, which is fundamentally different from a PRSA's purpose. 4) The scheme is employer-sponsored and trustee-administered, whereas PRSAs are individual pension contracts. Since Regulation 378 specifically pertains to PRSAs and the information requirements for PRSAs, and this document relates to an entirely different type of pension product, the regulation is not applicable.",
