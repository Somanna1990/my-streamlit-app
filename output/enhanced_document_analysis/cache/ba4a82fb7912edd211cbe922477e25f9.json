  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation (Section 83) specifically addresses conditions under which regulated entities can opt out of displaying warning statements in advertisements. The document provided is a comprehensive pension scheme rules document that outlines the terms, conditions, and operational details of a pension life cover scheme. It is not an advertisement - rather, it is a formal legal/contractual document that establishes and governs the scheme. The document contains detailed definitions, scheme operations, benefits, trustee duties, and administrative procedures. While the document is from a regulated entity (AIB life), this particular regulation about advertisement warning statements is not relevant to this type of document. The document's purpose is to serve as scheme rules rather than to advertise or promote financial services.",
