  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of a company pension scheme. It does not contain any procedures or policies about handling customer complaints. 2) While Section 6 'Contacting Us' provides contact details for AIB life, it only gives general contact information and does not mention anything about complaints handling. 3) The document's purpose is to establish and govern a pension scheme between an employer and trustees, rather than set out consumer-facing procedures. 4) The regulation specifically addresses how regulated entities should handle oral complaints from consumers, but this document's scope is limited to defining the rules and operation of a pension life cover scheme. While AIB life is mentioned as the life office provider, their complaint handling procedures would be covered in separate consumer-facing documentation, not in scheme rules.",
