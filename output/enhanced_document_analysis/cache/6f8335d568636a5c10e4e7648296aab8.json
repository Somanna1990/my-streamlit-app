  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation regarding trusted contact persons does not apply to this document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that specifically outlines the operation of a death benefit scheme for company pensions. It does not deal with consumer banking or retail financial services where trusted contact person provisions would typically apply. 2) The document's scope is limited to defining the relationship between employers, trustees, and beneficiaries in the context of a pension death benefit scheme. The roles and responsibilities are already clearly defined through the trustee structure. 3) The document already has robust governance mechanisms through the trustee structure and clear procedures for handling benefits and communications. 4) The scheme is specifically designed as an occupational pension scheme governed by the Pensions Act and TCA, with trustees having specific legal obligations and powers that would supersede any trusted contact person arrangement. 5) The document deals with institutional rather than personal consumer relationships, making the trusted contact person regulation inapplicable.",

  "regulation_text": "36. (1) A regulated entity shall, at the request of a personal consumer, record the name and contact information of an individual (referred to in this Regulation as a \"trusted contact person\") who the consumer has nominated and agreed, in accordance with paragraph (3), that the regulated entity may contact in circumstances where - (a) the regulated entity has a concern about possible financial abuse of the personal consumer, (b) the regulated entity needs to confirm the specifics of - (i) the consumer's current contact information, (ii) the consumer's health status, or (iii) the identity of any appointed legal guardian, executor or trustee, or (c) the regulated entity experiences difficulties in communicating with the consumer. (2) Where a regulated entity decides to contact a trusted contact person, the regulated entity may, provided that the regulated entity complies with paragraph (3), disclose confidential information about the personal consumer to the trusted contact person for the purposes of discussing the relevant matter referred to in paragraph (1). (3) Paragraph (2) does not apply unless the regulated entity has received - (a) the written consent of the personal consumer that the regulated entity may contact the trusted contact person in the relevant circumstances referred to in paragraph (1) to discuss confidential information in relation to that matter with the trusted con tact person, and (b) the written consent of the trusted contact person confirming that the regulated entity may - (i) retain the trusted contact person's name and contact information for the purposes referred to in paragraph (1), (ii) contact the trusted contact person in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (1), and (iii) discuss the matters referred to in paragraph (1) with the relevant trusted contact person. (4) For the avoidance of doubt, a trusted contact person has no authority to deal with the affairs of a personal consumer in respect of a regulated entity, and is not a legal representative for the purposes of these Regulations, solely on account of having bee n recorded or contacted by the regulated entity as a trusted contact person. (5) Subject to paragraph (6), this Regulation does not apply where the regulated entity is aware that - (a) a decision -making representative has been appointed in respect of the personal consumer and the appointment is in effect, (b) the personal consumer has appointed an attorney under an enduring power of attorney and the enduring power of attorney is in effect, (c) the personal consumer has appointed an attorney under an enduring power under the Act of 1996 and the enduring power under the Act of 1996 is in effect, (d) the personal consumer has appointed a decision -making assistant and the appointment is in effect, or (e) the personal consumer has appointed a co -decision maker and the appointment is in effect. (6) Paragraph (5) does not invalidate the nomination of a trusted contact person who has been nominated and agreed in accordance with this Regulation prior to the coming into effect of an arrangement referred to in paragraph (5)(a) to (e). (7) In this Regulation, \"co -decision maker\", \"decision -making assistant\", \"decision -making representative\", \"enduring power of attorney\" and \"enduring power under the Act of 1996\" have the meaning assigned to them in section 2 of the Act of 2015.",
