  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the structure, operation and benefits of a company pension scheme. It does not contain any provisions or policies regarding gifts or rewards. 2) The document focuses on defining trustee duties, scheme benefits, and administrative procedures rather than conduct rules around gifts/rewards. 3) While AIB Life is mentioned as the life office and registered administrator, the document does not address their employee conduct policies or gift-giving practices. 4) The document's scope is limited to the technical and legal framework of operating the pension scheme, not the business conduct standards of the regulated entities involved. The regulation in question specifically deals with preventing conflicts of interest from gifts/rewards between regulated entities and consumers, which is outside the scope of this scheme rules document.",
