  "applicability": "Does Not Apply",
  "applicability_reasoning": "This regulation does not apply to the document for several key reasons: 1) The document is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a company pension death benefit scheme. It does not deal with insurance rebates or rebate cheques which are the specific focus of Regulation 352. 2) The document describes a pure protection product administered by AIB Life as a pension scheme, not a general insurance product where rebates would typically apply. 3) There are no provisions or mentions in the document about rebates, refunds, or cheque processing to consumers. The only refund mentioned is related to excess proceeds being returned to employers, which is different from consumer rebates. 4) The scheme described is an occupational pension scheme governed primarily by pension legislation and Revenue rules, not general insurance consumer protection regulations about rebate processing.",
