  "compliance_reasoning": "The regulation applies because this document is from AIB Life, a product producer of a financial nature (pension life cover). The document shows some effort to enable consumer understanding through definitions and explanations, but lacks certain elements that would fully satisfy the regulation's requirements for clear consumer understanding. While the document includes definitions and explains the scheme's purpose, it doesn't appear to have been designed with sufficient consideration for consumer understanding based on the target market. The language is somewhat technical and the structure could be improved to better facilitate comprehension.",

  "gap_description": "The document lacks evidence of: 1) Having been specifically designed with consumer understanding as a primary consideration for the target market; 2) Being incorporated into a documented product design process; 3) Having a process to regularly review, test and monitor the effectiveness of the information. The document uses technical language and complex sentence structures in places that may impede consumer understanding.",
  "gap_recommendations": "1) Revise the document with a clearer focus on consumer understanding, using simpler language and more explanatory content; 2) Include a plain-language summary at the beginning that clearly explains the product's purpose, benefits, and limitations; 3) Implement and document a process for designing consumer-facing materials with consumer understanding as a primary consideration; 4) Establish and document a regular review process to test and monitor the effectiveness of the information with actual consumers from the target market; 5) Consider using more visual aids, examples, and scenarios to illustrate how the product works.",
