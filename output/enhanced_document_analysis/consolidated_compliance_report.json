    "gap_description": "- **Lack of Customer Guidance and Information Clarity:** The document fails to adequately explain the consequences of various customer decisions, including retirement options, fees, charges, tax implications, and the effects of electronic signatures. This deficiency risks leaving customers uninformed and potentially misled, particularly in making vital financial decisions.\n\n- **Insufficient Commitment to Regulatory Compliance:** The document does not explicitly state adherence to key regulatory requirements, such as securing customers' interests, acting with integrity, and treating customers fairly. It mentions fair treatment only in specific contexts without making a general commitment, thus potentially violating regulatory mandates.\n\n- **Inconsistent and Misleading Information Presentation:** Contradictory statements regarding electronic signatures and future-dated information about assets under management may confuse customers, contrary to the regulation's requirement for clear and effective information provision.\n\n- **Incomplete Risk, Fee, and Benefit Disclosure:** There is an absence of comprehensive explanations about risks, benefits, and the cumulative impact of charges on investments over time. Without examples or context, customers may struggle to understand the real effects of additional charges and active management benefits, hindering informed decision-making.\n\n- **Inadequate Health and Data Process Explanations:** The document lacks clarity on critical aspects such as the impact of health information on policy decisions, the use of customer data in underwriting, and specific conditions that must be reported. This gap can result in uncertainty and potential non-compliance related to customer best interest considerations.",

This includes offering illustrative examples and explanatory text for complex concepts, defining technical terms in consumer-friendly language, and explaining the cumulative impact of fees and charges.\n\n- **Prioritize Transparency and Customer Interests:** Explicitly state commitments to securing customer interests by acting honestly, with integrity, and diligently. Ensure all information presented is balanced, including the benefits and drawbacks of all options, to empower customers to make fully informed decisions. Include explicit confirmations of acting in the best interest of customers throughout all processes, supported by transparent timing and valuation justifications.\n\n- **Improve Data Protection and Customer Rights Communication:** Enhance data protection transparency and explain the use and protection of customer information in specific processes, such as underwriting and withdrawals. Include sections that clarify customers' rights to their information and how these rights are safeguarded.\n\n- **Include Comprehensive Fee and Charge Information:** Clearly outline all fees and charges associated with products and services, ensuring these are detailed enough to allow customers to understand the full cost impact. Provide fund-specific risk information and include a total expense ratio or reduction in yield figure for better financial planning.\n\n- **Facilitate Access to Further Guidance and Assistance:** Provide contact information and resources for customers needing assistance or additional guidance with forms, retirement options, or other queries. Encourage seeking independent financial advice for complex decision-making to ensure comprehensive understanding and alignment with customer interests.\n\n- **Commit to Regulatory Compliance and Monitoring:** Ensure all communications and actions align with relevant financial regulations, such as the CENTRAL BANK REFORM ACT 2010 and applicable Standards for Business regulations. Regularly update documents to reflect these regulations and resolve any contractual ambiguities, like electronic signature acceptances, to maintain compliance and prevent legal discrepancies."

This oversight fails to meet the specific details required under the regulation.\n\n\u2022 **Non-compliance on Business Stationery:** The regulation requires that all business stationery related to regulated activities must include a compliant regulatory disclosure statement. Several documents, such as brochures and fund guides, have been identified as missing this essential information.\n\n\u2022 **Advertisements Lacking Required Disclosures:** Some entities\u2019 advertisements related to regulated activities do not contain the necessary regulatory disclosure statement. This missing information can lead to non-compliance with consumer protection regulations.\n\n\u2022 **Misleading Impressions of Regulatory Approval:** In some documents, there is an impression that regulatory approval by other authorities suffices for compliance.

Suggested locations include the cover page, first page, introductory section, or in the header/footer to maximize visibility.\n\n- **Include Trading Names:** Incorporate all relevant trading names used by the entity within the regulatory disclosure statement, ensuring it reflects the financial services concerned and adheres to the formats provided by the regulation.\n\n- **Avoid Endorsement Impressions:** Carefully present the regulatory disclosure statement to prevent any impression that it serves as an endorsement by either the Central Bank of Ireland or any other competent authority. Ensure the language is neutral and compliant with Regulation 71(5).\n\n- **Manual Review for Compliance:** Conduct a manual review of all relevant documents to confirm compliance with Regulation 71. Verify that the regulatory disclosure statement is appropriately formatted, located, and follows all specified guidelines.\n\n- **Update All Advertising Materials:** Ensure that any advertisements referencing regulated activities include the correct regulatory disclosure statement. Present it clearly to align with Regulation 71(6), especially for entities like crowdfunding service providers as outlined in Regulation 71(7).\n\n- **Regular Compliance Checks:** Integrate regular checks into the document update process to maintain ongoing compliance with Regulation 71, ensuring any changes to regulatory status or trading names are promptly reflected in the disclosure statements."

    "gap_description": "- **Lack of Explicit Retention Period Disclosure:** Numerous documents do not explicitly state the 6-year retention period required by Regulation 117 for consumer transaction records and other records, leading to a significant gap in transparency and compliance.\n\n- **Absence of Consumer Notification:** The documents fail to inform consumers directly about the 6-year retention period for records detailing consumer transactions and records provided to consumers, as specified in Regulation 117, resulting in unclear communication.\n\n- **Inadequate Detailing of Record Retention Policies:** There is a notable absence of information regarding record retention policies in the documents themselves, even when a Data Privacy Notice is referenced. This gap may lead to consumer misunderstandings about how long their records will be kept.\n\n- **Non-disclosure of Compliance Flexibilities:** Documents do not cover specific clauses of the regulation, such as the 12-month retention period under certain consumer consent conditions or situations where service requests do not culminate in service provision. This omission results in incomplete regulatory compliance disclosures.\n\n- **Dissimilarities in Documentation Practice:** Some documents indicate that record retention details are contained in other documents like policy conditions or Data Privacy Notices, but lack of direct inclusion in the consumer-facing documents results in inconsistency and potential non-compliance with Regulation 117.\n\n- **Misleading Indications of Legal Compliance:** Phrases such as \"keeping information for any period after that required by law\" are used without specifying actual retention periods, which could mislead consumers about adherence to the specific retention durations mandated by the regulation.\n\n- **Under-communication of Service Cessation Record Requirements:** Documents do not consistently specify the requirement to retain records for 6 years after the cessation of providing financial services to a consumer, as mandated by Regulation 117(1)(b). This could obscure consumer understanding of how their data is managed post-service termination.",
    "gap_recommendations": "\n\u2022 **Establish Clear Record Retention Policies:** AIB Life should add explicit sections across all relevant documents, clearly stating that consumer transaction records must be retained for 6 years after the transaction is discontinued or completed. Additionally, state that other consumer records should be retained for 6 years after ceasing to provide financial services, in compliance with Regulation 117.\n\n\u2022 **Include Consent Provisions for Incomplete Services:** Update documents to include provisions for the 12-month retention period for records related to requests or offers for financial services that were not completed, subject to consumer consent. Clearly inform consumers of their right to consent or withdraw consent to record retention in these cases.\n\n\u2022 **Integrate Record Retention Details in Multiple Customer Communications:** Incorporate record retention information in every point of consumer interaction, such as forms, brochures, and policy documents. Use straightforward language like \"AIB Life will retain records of this transaction for 6 years,\" ensuring consistency with Regulation 117.\n\n\u2022 **Enhance Data Protection Notices:** While existing Data Privacy Notices are mentioned, ensure they explicitly reference the 6-year retention period for both completed and incomplete consumer transactions. Consider adding cross-references to these notices in related consumer documents.\n\n\u2022 **Update Policy and Brochure Sections:** Include specific sections on record retention policies within brochures, under sections such as 'Data Protection,' 'Important Information,' or 'Questions and Answers,' and adjust policy conditions to reflect these retention periods.\n\n\u2022 **Develop Staff Training and Documentation Processes:** Ensure all staff members are adequately trained on the updated record retention requirements, including the 6-year and 12-month consent-based provisions. Implement a comprehensive document management system to support these compliance measures.\n\n\u2022 **Communicate Consumer Rights:** Clarify in consumer documents how consumers can request access to their records during the retention period. Ensure that there is consistent communication about consumers\u2019 rights regarding data retention and consent withdrawal."

    "gap_description": "- **Imbalance in Consumer Responsibilities:** Several documents place the burden of accuracy entirely on the consumer, suggesting that inaccuracies could void contracts. This imbalance overlooks the entity\u2019s duties and responsibilities, potentially violating Regulation 128 by implying exclusion or restriction of the entity's legal liability or duty of care.\n\n- **Broad Liability Exclusion Clauses:** A clause on page 9 broadly excludes liability for any loss, damage, or inconvenience. This blanket exclusion is potentially non-compliant with Regulation 128, as it lacks proper limitations to safeguard legal duties and obligations the entity owes to consumers.\n\n- **Ambiguities in Language Around Legal Duties:** Documents contain language that could be interpreted as limiting liability, such as reserving the right to amend charging structures or ensuring communication in English without clarifications that these do not negate legal obligations. This can imply restricted duties, contrary to Regulation 128.\n\n- **Brochure and Contract Discrepancy:** The document attempts to exclude the brochure from the contractual framework, stating policy conditions prevail. This may serve to exclude liability for information within the brochure, counter to Regulation 128's requirement to maintain consistent duty of care obligations.\n\n- **Lack of Affirmative Acknowledgement of Duties:** There is a consistent omission of explicit statements affirming the entity's legal duties and liabilities. Focusing purely on investment risks without addressing comprehensive responsibilities contravenes Regulation 128's mandates for transparency in obligations.\n\n- **Overemphasis on Consumer Risk Without Entity Accountability:** Documents stress standard risk warnings related to consumer investments, yet fail to clearly affirm that these do not diminish the entity's legal liabilities or duty of care. This oversight could be viewed as sidestepping the responsibilities outlined by Regulation 128.",

Include language that reinforces the commitment to legal responsibilities and clarifies that such duties are not restricted or excluded under any circumstances.\n\n- **Proportional Consequences for Inaccuracies:** Adjust terms related to consumer-provided information to ensure that the consequences for inaccuracies are proportionate. Avoid clauses suggesting complete contract voidance for any inaccuracy, and align penalties with relevant consumer protection laws.\n\n- **Force Majeure Clause Review:** Revise the force majeure clauses to narrow their scope and eliminate blanket exclusions of liability for 'any loss, damage or inconvenience caused.' Ensure that exclusions do not apply to legal liabilities or duties of care owed under financial services legislation, and add language about mitigating the impact on consumers.\n\n- **Legal and Consumer Clarity:** Ensure that consumer rights and responsibilities, as well as the entity's own obligations, are clearly stated and visible. Avoid burying these statements in fine print or technical language, and use plain, understandable language for consumer ease.\n\n- **Brochure and Policy Alignment:** Ensure that promotional materials like brochures accurately represent the terms stated in policy conditions. Remove disclaimers that might subordinate consumer understanding or misrepresent the legal stance of the entity.\n\n- **Legal Compliance Review:** Engage legal counsel to review revised documents, ensuring they meet the compliance requirements of Regulation 128 and other applicable financial services legislation. This step should include a compliance audit of all consumer-facing materials to identify potential implicit exclusions or restrictions."

The training should cover both regulatory responsibilities and the practical application of compliance requirements.\n\n- **Enhance Charge Transparency and Consumer Understanding:** Revise documentation to clearly present charge structures, including information about possible changes to charges. Use illustrative examples to demonstrate impacts on investment growth, and provide comparative data to help consumers gauge competitiveness.\n\n- **Improve Presentation of Exit Charges:** Highlight the potential impacts of early exit charges on consumer outcomes through enhanced document presentation, ensuring that these charges are clearly visible and understood within consumer materials."

This issue is critical as proper information segregation is fundamental to protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.\n\n- **Neglect of Information Barriers in Compliance Documentation:**\n  The focus of the documents on other aspects, such as policy benefits and terms for customers, results in inadequate attention to internal compliance procedures related to information barriers. This gap suggests a potential oversight in prioritizing compliance obligations over customer communication.\n\n- **Inadequate Addressing of Conflicts of Interest:**\n  Specific mechanisms by which conflicts of interest with consumers are prevented through information segregation are not addressed. Without these mechanisms being clearly documented and enforced, the entities remain vulnerable to conflicts that could damage consumer trust and regulatory compliance.",
    "gap_recommendations": "\u2022 **Establish and Document Information Barriers:** Develop and document detailed descriptions of information barriers between different employees, business areas, and connected parties, such as AIB life and AIB. Ensure this documentation clearly delineates how consumer information is segregated to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\n\u2022 **Implement and Communicate Maintenance Procedures:** Create comprehensive procedures for the robust maintenance of information barriers and outline specific strategies for handling breaches. Clearly communicate these procedures to relevant employees through formal notifications to ensure complete awareness and adherence.\n\n\u2022 **Address Breach Management:** Outline clear protocols for identifying, reporting, and managing breaches of information barriers. This should include steps to mitigate any potential impacts on confidentiality and conflicts of interest and involve training sessions for employees on breach management.\n\n\u2022 **Ensure Employee Awareness and Compliance:** Establish a formal notification and training process to ensure all relevant officers and employees are aware of the procedures for information barriers. This includes periodic updates and mandatory acknowledgment of their understanding and compliance with these procedures.\n\n\u2022 **Incorporate Segregation and Conflict Avoidance Measures:** Detail explicit procedures for segregating sensitive customer information within different operating units to preserve confidentiality and prevent potential conflicts of interest. This should be integrated into the operational workflow and revisited periodically for relevance and effectiveness.\n\n\u2022 **Develop Consumer-Facing and Internal Documentation:** Create both consumer-facing and internal documents that reference the established information barrier policies, ensuring alignment with Regulation 28. Consumer documents should offer transparency on information handling, while internal documents should provide detailed compliance frameworks.\n\n"

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a trusted contact person has no authority to deal with the affairs of a personal consumer in respect of a regulated entity, and is not a legal representative for the purposes of these Regulations, solely on account of having bee n recorded or contacted by the regulated entity as a trusted contact person.

    "gap_description": "\n- **Incomplete Breakdown of Charges:** The document fails to provide a comprehensive breakdown of all charges, including any potential third-party charges, as required by the regulation. This absence means consumers are not fully informed about the financial commitments involved in policy alterations.\n\n- **Timing of Charge Disclosure:** There is no evidence that the breakdown of charges is provided to the consumer prior to the provision of the financial service, as mandated by Regulation 66(1). This means consumers may be committing to services without a full understanding of the cost.\n\n- **Lack of Durable Medium:** The regulation requires that the charges be presented in written form on paper or another durable medium. However, directing customers to an online remuneration summary does not meet this requirement, which potentially leaves the charge information inaccessible or ephemeral.\n\n- **Ambiguity in Section 4.4 Content:** The 'Charges' section (4.4) mentioned in the document is not provided in full, making it impossible to determine if it contains a complete breakdown of all charges, including third-party charges. This lack of transparency hinders verification of compliance.\n\n- **Inadequate Written Instructions for Advisors:** The document does not clearly instruct advisors to provide a complete written breakdown of all charges, which could lead to inconsistent or incomplete information being provided to the consumer.\n\n- **Absence of Explicit Commitment to Regulation 66 Compliance:** While some documents acknowledge the need for charge disclosure, they do not explicitly confirm that a complete pre-service written breakdown of all charges is provided, which is essential for full regulatory compliance.\n\n",

This template must be provided on paper or another durable medium to customers before any financial service is rendered.\n\n- **Explicit Compliance Confirmation:** Include a specific section within relevant documents that explicitly confirms compliance with Regulation 66. This section should detail how the document meets the regulation requirements, including the provision of a complete charges breakdown.\n\n- **Pre-Service Confirmation Checklist:** Incorporate a step in any pre-service or initial consultation checklist to confirm that customers have received and acknowledged the written breakdown of charges. This ensures compliance and provides a point of reference for internal reviews.\n\n- **Cross-Referencing Additional Documents:** If the breakdown of charges is provided in a separate document, ensure clear cross-referencing within the primary document to this additional information. The primary document should explicitly state that the additional breakdown will be provided before any service is rendered.\n\n- **Documentation and Evidence Retention:** Establish documentation and record-keeping procedures that retain evidence of the written breakdown of charges provided to customers. This includes maintaining copies on durable media and recording customer acknowledgments when applicable.\n\n- **Charges Clarity and Transparency:** Present charges information in a clear and transparent format, possibly using tables for clarity. Ensure that variable charges or charges contingent on specific conditions are clearly explained and that the charges section is distinct from general information."

Utilize section headers and a structured layout to avoid obscuring critical information due to design or format elements.\n\n\u2022 **Appropriate Use of Small Print and Footnotes:** Restrict the use of small print or footnotes to supplement or elaborate on the main text. Ensure they do not contain primary key information and are of sufficient size to be legible, thereby preventing the possibility of crucial details being overlooked.\n\n\u2022 **Comprehensive Document Review:** Conduct a thorough review of the document's design and layout to ensure no key information is relegated to small print or obscured. The main body should integrate vital content previously included in sections labeled as 'IMPORTANT NOTICE' or other secondary notations."

The amount owed plus the added interest is then payable in full in circumstances such a s death, or permanent vacation or sale of the mortgaged property.\"; (b) in respect of a lifetime mortgage where interest is charged on an increasing sum (made up of the outstanding mortgage and added interest amounts), but no scheduled repayments are required to be made, the interest then being added to the outstanding debt on a continual basis: \"Warning: Unlike certain other mortgages where interest is charged on a sum that decreases with time, interest on lifetime mortgages is charged on an increasing sum (made up of the outstanding mortgage and added interest amounts), and therefore the total amount owed can increase quickly. As you are not required to make any scheduled repayments, the interest on your mortgage is added to your outstanding debt on a continual basis and you are effectively charged interest on that interest. This is called \u2018com pound interest'.\"; (c) in respect of a lifetime mortgage where the debt, if unpaid, could come close to, or equal or exceed the value of the mortgaged residential property: \"Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to, equal, or exceed, the value of the mortgaged residential property.\"; (d) in respect of a lifetime mortgage where the debt, if unpaid, could come close to or equal, but not exceed, the value of the mortgaged residential property: \"Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to or equal, the value of the mortgaged residential property.\"; (e) in respect of all lifetime mortgages: \"Warning: Purchasing this product may negatively impact on your ability to fund future needs.

As you are not required make any scheduled repayments, the interest on your mortgage is added to your outstanding debt on a continual basis and you are effectively charged interest on that interest.

(3) Where a regulated entity is considering alternative repayment arrangement options in respect of a mortgage loan with a tracker interest rate in accordance with Regulation 253(1) to Regulation 253(4) and the regulated entity concludes that there is no optio n which is appropriate and sustainable for the mortgage borrower's individual circumstances whereby the mortgage borrower may retain the tracker interest rate, the regulated entity may offer the mortgage borrower an alternative repayment arrangement pu rsuant to which the tracker interest rate is amended to an interest rate other than a tracker interest rate, if that alternative repayment arrangement is a long -term appropriate and sustainable arrangement for the mortgage borrower, and the reasons for same are documented in accordance with Regulation 253(5) and Regulation 253(6). (4) This Chapter does not prevent a regulated entity agreeing an alternative repayment arrangement with a mortgage borrower for a limited period of time, prior to completing its assessment of the mortgage borrower's standard financial statement, if a delay in agreeing an alternative repayment arrangement would exacerbate a mortgage borrower's arrears or, in a pre -arrears case, the mortgage borrower's relevant financial difficulty or likelihood of financial difficulty. (5) For the purpose of paragraph (4), \"limited period of time\" means a period of time sufficient to enable the regulated entity to receive and complete a full review of the standard financial statement.",

Consider sections discussing investment risks, such as PRSAs, PRBs, and ARFs. Ensure the warning is clearly visible and not hidden or minimized in any way.\n\n- **Enhanced Formatting for Visibility:** The warning statement should be formatted to stand out. Use bold text, a highlighted box, or other contrasting formatting methods to ensure that the warning catches the consumer's attention and is easily noticeable.\n\n- **Placement in Early Sections:** Incorporate the warning statement in early sections of the document where the product is introduced. Make it a standard inclusion in introductory areas so that consumers encounter the warning before delving into detailed investment options.\n\n- **Dedicated 'Risk Warnings' Section:** Consider creating a dedicated section titled 'Important Information' or 'Risk Warnings' that consolidates all risk-related warnings, including the required investment risk warning. This section should be easy to find and designed to capture the consumer's attention.\n\n- **Regular Review and Compliance Check:** Establish a process for regular review of marketing materials and investment documents to ensure ongoing compliance with Regulation 382. This includes verifying the correct display and formatting of the warning statement in all relevant materials.\n\n- **Educational Initiatives for Compliance Teams:** Conduct training sessions for marketing and compliance teams on the importance and implementation of Regulation 382's warning statement requirements to ensure understanding and consistency in application across all relevant materials."

Position the warning notably in sections or slides (e.g., slides 6-12 for PRSAs) to maintain consistency across all product documentation.\n\n- **Highlighted Formatting:** Emphasize the warning through formatting techniques such as bold text or a distinct font size/color. This formatting ensures it stands out from other content and immediately captures the reader\u2019s attention.\n\n- **Inclusion in Terms of Business:** Update documents like the Terms of Business to include the warning in areas discussing investment products. Ensure its presence bolsters the document's compliance with financial regulations, reinforcing the awareness of potential fluctuations in investment value.\n\n- **Strategic Document Sections:** Position the warning prominently in strategic sections such as introductions, policy replacement sections, and discussions of fund values, ensuring the statement is accessible and prominent where it's most relevant to the scope of the product or service.\n\n- **Consistent Compliance Verification:** Regularly verify that the warning statement is included and prominently displayed in all relevant sections and documents. This routine check assists in maintaining ongoing compliance with Regulation 392, ensuring no oversight occurs in future documentation updates."

This should include specific risks like market risk, liquidity risk, concentration risk, etc., to help intermediaries convey a transparent risk profile to consumers.\n\n- **Guarantee Details:** Clearly state all information regarding any guarantees attached to the products. This includes specifying the level, nature, extent, and limitations of the guarantees, and providing the guarantor's name to ensure intermediaries fully comprehend the guarantees offered.\n\n- **Structured Information Format:** Develop a structured format that addresses all four elements required by Regulation 402 for each investment product. This format should be easy for intermediaries to reference and utilize when advising consumers, ensuring consistent compliance across all products.\n\n- **Include All Regulatory Elements:** Ensure that each investment product's description comprehensively addresses all requirements of Regulation 402. This includes key characteristics, target market, inherent risks, and guarantee information, thereby enabling intermediaries to offer well-informed advice to consumers."
