The document defines terms like 'consumer' and 'customer' which are relevant to the regulation. However, while the document provides definitions and explains the scheme's operation, it doesn't fully address all aspects of the regulation's definition requirements, particularly around consumer protection and financial abuse prevention.",
        "compliance_evidence": "Saol Assurance d.a.c., trading as AIB life, is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Registered in Ireland number 701277, VAT number 3804332MH.; The TCA specifies that a pension or an amount transferred into an ARF, should not exceed the maximum total benefits that could have been provided for the member assuming the deceased had continued service up to normal retirement age.; The scheme is a retirement benefits scheme as defined by Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA, capable of being approved by the Revenue Commissioners as an exempt approved scheme. The scheme may be established by way of a retirement benefits product as defined by Section 772A of the TCA unless premiums exceed the percentage of remuneration limits set out in the TCA, in which circumstances individual approval will be required and obtained from Revenue when the scheme is established.; The document contains definitions including: \"Dependant Means the member's spouse, civil partner, child under the age of 18 or under the age of 25 and still receiving full-time education or vocational training, or any other person who depends financially on the member as determined by the trustee.\" and \"Member (also known as the life covered in the Policy Schedule) Means an employee of the employer who is eligible for membership and is included in the scheme.

The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a death benefit-only occupational pension scheme. The scheme's main and only purpose, as stated in multiple sections, is 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' This is a pure protection product without any investment component. It does not meet the definition of a PRIIP as it has no investment element or surrender value. The document describes a straightforward group life insurance arrangement structured through an occupational pension scheme, which falls outside the scope of PRIIPs regulation. Additionally, the document shows this is regulated under the Pensions Act and administered through AIB life as a pure protection product, not an investment-based insurance product."

Occupational pension schemes are typically exempt from MiFID regulations as they are considered employee benefit arrangements rather than retail investment products. 3) The document describes an employer-sponsored scheme administered by trustees for the benefit of employees, which falls under pension legislation and trust law rather than consumer protection regulations. 4) The scheme is established as a retirement benefits scheme under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act and is regulated by the Pensions Authority, not primarily as a consumer financial product under Central Bank consumer protection regulations. 5) The relationship described in the document is between employer, trustee and member rather than a regulated entity and consumer relationship that these consumer protection regulations are designed to govern."

The regulation specifically addresses notification requirements around penalty charges, which is not relevant to the core purpose and operation of this pension scheme."

This indicates it is a single, defined product rather than one with optional add-ons. 4) While premiums and benefits are discussed, they are core elements of the product rather than optional extras that would require separate disclosure and consent under Regulation 94. 5) The document focuses on trustee duties, scheme rules, and benefit calculations rather than point-of-sale disclosures about optional features."

The contact section (Section 6) does mention phone contact but only for general customer service purposes, not for product sales or bundling discussions. Additionally, this appears to be a standalone pension life cover product rather than a bundled product, so regulations specific to bundling would not apply."

The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of a company pension scheme. While the document does mention AIB life as the life office and registered administrator, it does not contain any content related to proposed transfers or mergers between regulated entities. The document focuses on defining scheme rules, benefits, trustee duties, and wind-up procedures for a specific pension product. There are no provisions or discussions about mergers, acquisitions, or transfers of regulated activities between entities that would trigger the requirements under Regulation 126 regarding due diligence and service continuity in merger/transfer scenarios."

The document in question is a Pension Life Cover Scheme Rules document that outlines the rules and operation of an executive pension life cover scheme.

There are no joint account features or operations described in this document. The document deals with trust-based pension arrangements between an employer, trustee, and single member, which is fundamentally different from the joint consumer accounts that Regulation 127 is designed to govern."

The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme providing death benefits. The document is not a consumer insurance contract - it is an occupational pension scheme document governed by the Pensions Act 1990 and Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The document explicitly states it is an 'occupational pension scheme' established for company pensions, with the employer as trustee and AIB Life as the registered administrator. The terms being defined in Regulation 307 (Act of 2019, method of direct settlement, Personal Injuries Resolution Board) have no relevance to the administration or operation of this type of pension scheme. Additionally, the document's legal framework is clearly established under pension legislation rather than consumer protection or insurance contract law."

While it does discuss premiums in Section 2.3, these are employer-paid premiums for the pension scheme, not insurance premiums that would be subject to consumer rebates. The document makes no mention of premium rebates or consumer options regarding rebates. Additionally, the scheme is established as a trust-based pension arrangement governed by the Pensions Act and TCA (Taxes Consolidation Act), not as a direct consumer insurance product. The parties involved are the employer, trustees, and scheme member in their capacity as an employee, rather than as a consumer in the context of the Consumer Protection Regulations."

The benefits are predetermined lump sums and/or pensions for dependants in the event of death. 4) The scheme rules make clear this is an employer-sponsored death benefit arrangement, not a consumer investment product subject to suitability assessments under CPC regulations."

The scheme's main and only purpose is explicitly stated as 'to provide benefits for the member's dependants if the member dies before normal retirement age.' 2) While the document is related to a financial product, it is specifically a pure protection product (life insurance) rather than an investment product. The benefits are fixed amounts paid on death and do not have an investment component. 3) The document focuses on defining scheme rules, trustee duties, and benefit calculations rather than product distribution or sales processes. 4) The regulation in question (410) specifically applies to investment products and their target markets, while this document pertains to a protection-only insurance scheme with no investment element. The scheme rules show this is a risk-only product designed to provide death benefits, not an investment vehicle."

The document in question is a pension life cover scheme rules document that outlines the operation of an occupational pension scheme. The document is governed by different regulatory frameworks, specifically: 1) The Pensions Act 1990, 2) The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and 3) Revenue Commissioner requirements. The document makes no reference to consumer lending or general insurance matters that would fall under the scope of the revoked regulations mentioned in Section 418. Additionally, as this is an occupational pension scheme document primarily dealing with employer-trustee relationships and death benefits, it falls outside the scope of the consumer protection regulations being revoked. The document is instead regulated by pension-specific legislation and tax law."
