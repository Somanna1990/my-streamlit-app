As you are not required to make any scheduled repayments, the interest on your mortgage is added to your outstanding debt on a continual basis and you are effectively charged interest on that interest.

The amount owed plus the added interest is then payable in full in circumstances such as death, or permanent vacation or sale of the mortgaged property.\"; (b) in respect of a lifetime mortgage where interest is charged on an increasing sum (made up of the outstanding mortgage and added interest amounts), but no scheduled repayments are required to be made, the interest then being added to the outstanding debt on a continual basis: \"Warning: Unlike certain other mortgages where interest is charged on a sum that decreases with time, interest on lifetime mortgages is charged on an increasing sum (made up of the outstanding mortgage and added interest amounts), and therefore the total amount owed can increase quickly. As you are not required make any scheduled repayments, the interest on your mortgage is added to your outstanding debt on a continual basis and you are effectively charged interest on that interest. This is called ‘compound interest'.\"; (c) in respect of a lifetime mortgage with a variable interest rate that does not involve scheduled repayments of interest, where the regulated entity has discretion to vary the interest rate: \"Warning: the rate of interest applied to your loan balance may increase and the amount you owe will increase as a result.\"; (d) in respect of a lifetime mortgage where the debt, if unpaid, could come close to, or equal or exceed the value of the mortgaged residential property: \"Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to, equal, or exceed the value of the mortgaged residential property.\"; (e) in respect of a lifetime mortgage where the debt, if unpaid, could come close to or equal, but not exceed, the value of the mortgaged residential property: \"Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to or equal, the value of the mortgaged residential property.\"; (f) in respect of all lifetime mortgages: \"Warning: Purchasing this product may negatively impact on your ability to fund future needs. Before purchasing this product, you should get independent legal or financial advice.\"; (g) in respect of a lifetime mortgage where charges apply to early repayment: \"Warning: You will have to pay charges if you pay off a lifetime mortgage early.\".

(1) Where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a regulated entity to a mortgage borrower in a case referred to in Regulation 240, the regulated entity shall advise the mortgage borrower to take appropriate independent legal advice, financial advi ce, or both, and shall provide the mortgage borrower with a clear explanation, on paper or on another durable medium, of how the alternative repayment arrangement works, including the following information: (a) the reasons why the alternative repayment arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable for the mortgage borrower's individual circumstances as documented by the regulated entity in accordance with Regulation 253(5) and Regulation 253(6), including demonstrating, by reference to the mortgage borrower's individual circumstances, the advantages of the offer for the mortgage borrower and explaining any disadvantages; (b) the new mortgage loan repayment amount; (c) the term of the alternative repayment arrangement; (d) the implications of entering into the alternative repayment arrangement for the mortgage borrower's existing mortgage loan, including the impact on - (i) the mortgage loan term, (ii) the balance outstanding on the mortgage loan account, and (iii) the existing arrears on the mortgage loan account, if any; (e) a statement that the alternative repayment arrangement may impact on the mortgage borrower's mortgage protection insurance cover; (f) the frequency with which the alternative repayment arrangement will be reviewed by the regulated entity in accordance with Regulation 257(1), the reason for undertaking such reviews and the potential outcome of any such reviews where - (i) the mortgage borrower's circumstances which require the alternative repayment arrangement improve, (ii) the mortgage borrower's circumstances which require the alternative repayment arrangement disimprove, and (iii) the mortgage borrower's circumstances which require the alternative repayment arrangement remain the same; (g) details of any residual mortgage debt which, at the end of the term of an alternative repayment arrangement, will remain due and owing by the mortgage borrower; (h) information on how interest will be applied to the mortgage loan account as a result of entering into the alternative repayment arrangement; (i) information on how the alternative repayment arrangement will be reported by the regulated entity to the Central Credit Register or any other credit reference agency or credit register, and the anticipated impact of entering into this arrangement on th e mortgage borrower's credit report; (j) the timeframe within which the mortgage borrower is required to accept or decline the offer. (2) A regulated entity shall not require a mortgage borrower in a case referred to in Regulation 240 to agree to amend his or her mortgage interest rate from a tracker interest rate to an interest rate other than a tracker interest rate, as part of agreeing to any alternative repayment arrangement offered to the mortgage borrower, except in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (3). (3) Where a regulated entity is considering alternative repayment arrangement options in respect of a mortgage loan with a tracker interest rate in accordance with Regulation 253(1) to Regulation 253(4) and the regulated entity concludes that there is no optio n which is appropriate and sustainable for the mortgage borrower's individual circumstances whereby the mortgage borrower may retain the tracker interest rate, the regulated entity may offer the mortgage borrower an alternative repayment arrangement pu rsuant to which the tracker interest rate is amended to an interest rate other than a tracker interest rate, if that alternative repayment arrangement is a long -term appropriate and sustainable arrangement for the mortgage borrower, and the reasons for same are documented in accordance with Regulation 253(5) and Regulation 253(6). (4) This Chapter does not prevent a regulated entity agreeing an alternative repayment arrangement with a mortgage borrower for a limited period of time, prior to completing its assessment of the mortgage borrower's standard financial statement, if a delay in agreeing an alternative repayment arrangement would exacerbate a mortgage borrower's arrears or, in a pre -arrears case, the mortgage borrower's relevant financial difficulty or likelihood of financial difficulty. (5) For the purpose of paragraph (4), \"limited period of time\" means a period of time sufficient to enable the regulated entity to receive and complete a full review of the standard financial statement.",

(b) For the purposes of subparagraph (a)(i), a debt management firm shall not consider a reduction in debt repayments as constituting a cost saving where the total amount repayable in respect of that debt is increased or remains the same. (7) Where the debt management firm assesses that insolvency options are the most suitable course of action for the consumer, the debt management firm shall inform the consumer of how the consumer can obtain further information in connection with considering those options. (8) A debt management firm shall provide a signed and dated statement of advice to the consumer on paper or on another durable medium.
