Firms need to understand vulnerability, \n\nand to ensure that their culture, policies and \n\nprocesses take account of the needs of consumers in \n\nvulnerable circumstances.  \n\n \n\nSection 1 -  Introduction \n\n1.1.   Background \n\n1.1.1 \nConsumers in vulnerable circumstances are more likely to suffer financial \ndetriment or harm. They may make poor financial decisions and it is important, \ntherefore, that firms consider the needs of consumers in vulnerable \ncircumstances and provide additional supports as appropriate. The definition of \nconsumers in vulnerable circumstances is explored further in section 2.1 of this \nGuidance. \n\n1.1.2  \nThe purpose of this Guidance is to set out the background to the definition and \napproach to vulnerability under the Consumer Protection Code 1  (the Code), and \nto describe the Central Bank’s expectations of firms in meeting their obligations \nunder the Code.  \n\n1.1.3 \nThis Guidance can support firms in adopting the right mind-set and culture to \neffectively support consumers in vulnerable circumstances. We are seeking to \nembed an understanding of vulnerability within the culture of a firm, and to \nensure that the needs of consumers in vulnerable circumstances, and a \ncommitment to addressing these needs, is an integral part of a firm’s customer \nfocus. This will allow firms to be prepared and able to assist when they engage \nwith consumers in vulnerable circumstances. \n \n\n \n\n                                                                 \n1  S.I. 80 of 2025 The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 (Section 17A) (Standards for Business) Regulations 2025 (‘Standards for \nBusiness’) and S.I. 81 of 2025 Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Consumer Protection) \nRegulations 2025 (‘Consumer Protection Regulations’) together are called the Consumer Protection Code. \n\n[IMAGE BLOCK]",

G20/OECD High–Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection  \n\n1.2.1  \nThe   G20/OECD High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection 2  set out that \nfirms have a responsibility to treat all financial customers ‘equitably, honestly and \nfairly at all stages of their relationship with financial services providers’, and to ensure \nthat ‘special attention should be paid to the treatment of customers who may be \nexperiencing vulnerability’. Under Principle 6, the OECD sets out that ‘approaches \nmay take into account that consumer vulnerability can manifest differently in \ndifferent circumstances and may be due to a combination of personal characteristics, \neconomic situations and market conditions’.  \n\n1.2.2  \nThe definition of ‘consumers in vulnerable circumstances’ in the Code reflects the \nOECD’s approach to vulnerability under the High-Level Principles.  \n\n1.3.   Securing Customers’ Interests \n\n1.3.1  \nThe Code’s Standards for Business include a Standard that   requires firms to secure \nthe interests of their customers. This Standard is elaborated by Supporting Standards \nfor Business, and is further explained in Guidance on Securing Customers’ Interests, \nexploring what this means in practice.  \n\n1.3.2  \nThe overarching duty on firms to secure the interests of customers requires firms to \nsecure the interests of all customers, 3  including consumers in vulnerable \ncircumstances. Securing the interests of consumers in vulnerable circumstances \nrequires firms to understand vulnerability, to anticipate that some consumers may be \nin vulnerable circumstances, and to ensure that the culture, strategy, business model, \ndecision-making, systems, controls, policies, processes and procedures of firms take \naccount of their reasonable needs.  \n\n1.3.3  \nThe specific Code requirements 4  and Guidance on Protecting Consumers in \nVulnerable Circumstances 5  complement and build on the Standard for Business and \nour Guidance on Securing Customers’ Interests, recognising that consumers in \nvulnerable circumstances will require additional protection and support when \nengaging with financial services. \n\n                                                                 \n2  Instruments, O.L., 2012.

MiFID and Crowdfunding Services \n\n1.4.1  \nThe Code does not directly apply to firms when providing MiFID services 6  or to \ncrowdfunding services. 7  The Bank’s guidance on Securing Customers’ Interests, \nhowever, sets out that we expect firms providing MiFID services to consider and \napply that guidance in the context of fulfilling their obligation to  “act honestly, fairly \nand professionally in accordance with the best interests of  [their]  clients ” in accordance \nwith Regulation 31 of the MiFID Regulations. 8  For crowdfunding service providers, \nwe also expect firms to consider and apply the Securing Customers’ Interests \nguidance in the context of fulfilling their obligations to “ act honestly, fairly and \nprofessionally in accordance with the best interests of  [their]  clients ” under Article 3 of \nthe EU Crowdfunding Regulations. 9   \n\n1.4.2  \nSimilarly, the guidance, direction and learning for firms set out in this Guidance on \nProtecting Consumers in Vulnerable Circumstances should also be considered by \nfirms when providing MiFID services and crowdfunding services, where it explains \nhow firms can act in the best interests of consumers in vulnerable circumstances. It \nshould be noted, however, that the Central Bank does not expect crowdfunding \nservice providers, or firms providing MiFID services to comply with Trusted Contact \nPersons requirements and training requirements. \n\n1.5.   Reasonableness, Proportionality and Appropriate Levels of Care \n\n1.5.1  \nThe Code’s vulnerability requirements are grounded in proportionality, and an \nexpectation that firms will take reasonable steps to provide consumers in vulnerable \ncircumstances with appropriate levels of care. The requirements and guidance apply \nwhen firms are doing business with consumers who are natural persons.   \n\n1.5.2  \nAs there are different degrees of vulnerability, the steps firms need to take in specific \ncircumstances will take different forms. A firm’s approach to vulnerability also needs \nto reflect the nature and complexity of the products or services that are being offered \nto consumers.  \n\n1.5.3  \nConsidering the broad understanding of what circumstances make consumers \nvulnerable, firms are not expected to be able to identify all consumers in vulnerable \ncircumstances, nor to categorise or label consumers as such. What firms are expected \nto do is to understand and take account of the drivers of vulnerability that are \nrelevant to the business of the firm, and to design their systems, processes and \nprocedures so that consumers in vulnerable circumstances are reasonably protected \n\n                                                                 \n6  Services regulated by the Bank under the Markets in Financial Instruments framework. \n7  The Code does not apply to crowdfunding services, with the exception of a number of requirements relating to advertising.  \n8  S.I.

These systems, \nprocesses and procedures should include the reasonably expected due diligence that \nfirms would undertake when on-boarding any customer; and training staff to identify \nand understand those circumstances relevant to the business of the firm that may \nmake customers vulnerable. \n\n1.5.4  \nOur expectation is that firms will arrange their business and train their staff so that \nwhen consumers in vulnerable circumstances are identified, the firm is in a position to \ntake reasonable steps to support those consumers.  \n\n1.5.5  \nBy understanding vulnerability, meeting the requirements of the Code, and reflecting \na customer-focus across its business, a firm will improve the outcomes for consumers \nin vulnerable circumstances overall, and thereby meet the standard required by the \nCode. \n\n1.6.   Structure of Guidance \n\n1.6.1  \nThe Guidance set out in Section 2 outlines what the definition of consumers in \nvulnerable circumstances means, how firms should approach this definition, and how \nfirms should implement specific Code requirements relating to consumers in \nvulnerable circumstances. These requirements include: \n\no   Providing assistance in individual circumstances; \no   Providing appropriate training to staff so that they can identify and respond \nto consumers in vulnerable circumstances;  \no   Reporting concerns on financial abuse; and  \no   Facilitating the nomination of a Trusted Contact Person.  \n\n1.6.2  \nSection 3 of the Guidance examines how the approach to consumers in vulnerable \ncircumstances aligns with other relevant domestic and EU requirements. \n\n1.6.3  \nThroughout this guidance document we use the terms ‘consumer’ as in ’consumer \nprotection’, and ‘customer’ as in ‘securing customers’ interests’. These terms are used \ninterchangeably, and the use of one or other of the terms reflects the relationship \nthat a person, as a consumer, has with a financial services firm. ‘Consumer’ is \nnarrower than ‘customer’ and is defined in the Code as those customers who are \neither a natural person; a group of natural persons; an incorporated body with a \nturnover of up to €5 million, or a group of incorporated entities with a combined \nturnover of up to €5 million. \n ",

When we consider \nour consumer protection objective, we have regard to the principle that \nconsumers should take responsibility for their choices and decisions. However, \nwe know that there are very real factors that might limit their ability to do so.  \n \n2.1.2  \nCircumstances and characteristics of vulnerability may result in consumers having \nadditional or different needs, and may limit their ability or willingness to make \ndecisions and choices or to represent their own interests. These consumers may be at \ngreater risk of financial harm, particularly if things go wrong or financial products are \nunsuitable. Such a scenario was highlighted in a High Court case relating to the \nprovision of inappropriate investment advice to a client. The failure by the firm to get \nto know the client properly and the provision of inappropriate advice resulted in the \nclient experiencing significant financial loss where their circumstances meant that they \nrequired a steady return over time. 10  \n \n2.1.3  \nVulnerability is not always a static, innate or permanent characteristic of a person. It \nincludes any condition, characteristic or circumstance that makes a person more likely \nto suffer poor outcomes, particularly if firms do not act with the appropriate degree of \ncare. These conditions can arise because of health issues, life events or lack of \ncapability. Any circumstance that makes a consumer more prone to experiencing worse \noutcomes makes that person vulnerable. Moreover, individuals can move in and out of \n\nvulnerable circumstances (e.g. because of a bereavement, a job loss or ill health).  \n \n2.1.4  \nAs noted, firms are required to secure the interests of all customers. However, some \ncustomers will require additional support when engaging with financial services. These \nwill include those experiencing long-term vulnerability resulting from an inherent \ncharacteristic or those experiencing temporary vulnerability resulting from a specific \ntrigger, such as a bereavement.  \n \n2.1.5  \nThe approach to consumers in vulnerable circumstances should not be to label \nsome customers as vulnerable, and therefore, by extension others as not \nvulnerable. While there are clearly persons who have innate and permanent \nqualities that will mean that they need additional assistance, only focusing on \n\n                                                                 \n10   James Haughey v J&E trading as Davy, Bank of Ireland Mortgage Bank and Bank of Ireland  [2014] IEHC 206.

Financial services firms exist to \nprovide services and products to their customers. So the question firms must ask \nthemselves is what types of harm their customers may be vulnerable to, and how \nthis might impact their customer experience and outcomes.  \n \n2.1.8  \n‘Harm’ can be understood to mean the less favourable outcomes that may arise \nwhere a firm fails to act with the appropriate levels of care towards consumers in \nvulnerable circumstances, e.g. in the design of their business, delivery of their \nproducts and services, and other interactions with the consumer. For example, a \nconsumer may transact for products or services that are unsuitable for their \nneeds as a result of poor product design, ineffective communication or the use of \ninappropriate delivery channels.  \n\n2.2.  \nImplementing a Broader Concept of Consumers in Vulnerable \nCircumstances \n\n2.2.1  \nThe following sections outline what is reasonably expected of firms in order to \nproperly secure the interests of consumers in vulnerable circumstances. \n \n\nGovernance and Culture \n\n2.2.2  \nA firm’s directors and senior management should ensure that securing the fair \ntreatment of consumers in vulnerable circumstances is embedded as part of a \nconsumer-focused culture throughout the firm’s operations and processes, not \njust in customer facing areas of the firm but also in areas such as product and \nservice design.

Firms need to \nunderstand vulnerability, and the ways in which consumers in certain \ncircumstances can be vulnerable.  \n\n \n\n2.2.4  \nStaff should be enabled and encouraged to identify how they can reduce the \npotential for harm to consumers in vulnerable circumstances. This requires firms \nto ensure staff are sufficiently aware of the drivers of vulnerability. Firms should \nensure that all relevant staff have the appropriate skills and capabilities, as well as \nsupport from appropriate systems and processes, to understand and take into \naccount the needs of consumers in vulnerable circumstances in their work (see \nsection on training below). \n\n \n\n2.2.5  \nOverall, firms should understand the types and characteristics of vulnerability \nthat may exist in their target market and customer base, and the impact of these \nvulnerabilities on the financial needs of their customers, by identifying the types \nof risk to which their customers may be vulnerable. If firms do not understand the \ncharacteristics of vulnerability within their target market and customer base, and \nso fail to ensure products and services take account of these needs, those \ncustomers are at increased risk of experiencing poor or inconsistent outcomes.  \n\n \n\n2.2.6  \nConsideration of vulnerability should influence the design of a firm’s products, \npolicies and processes and should be reflected in all aspects of the customer \njourney.

They need to design their products and \nprocesses so that specific predictable vulnerabilities do not adversely impact on \nsome customers, resulting in less favourable outcomes.  \n \n2.2.8  \nDistributing products via a digital platform requires consideration of the potential \ndifferences in consumers’ understanding and capability to use such digital \nplatforms.

Under the definition of ‘consumer in vulnerable circumstances’ in the Code, \nthis extends beyond customers that are considered innately vulnerable, and \ncaptures circumstances of vulnerability across a broader spectrum of risk.  \n \n2.3.2  \nImportantly, this approach does not require individual customers to be \nconsidered as ‘vulnerable’ for firms to provide support, in line with the broader \nrequirements of the Code, including the requirement to secure customers’ \ninterests. For example, if a customer states that they do not understand \nsomething, or they need assistance, then a firm should take appropriate steps to \nsupport that customer’s understanding, regardless of whether an assessment of \nthat customer would reveal circumstances to suggest that they may be in \nvulnerable circumstances.  \n \n2.3.3  \nWe have seen examples where firms have provided assistance to customers to \naddress vulnerabilities associated with specific situations. In some cases, this \nassistance has been provided by individual firms, and in other cases by firms \nworking in conjunction with industry bodies and consumer representative bodies \nto ensure the appropriate supports are made available to consumers.  \n \n\n•   For consumers dealing with financial hardship, the Banking and Payments \nFederation Ireland (BPFI) and Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) \nprotocol is an agreement between the BPFI and MABS which outlines how \nborrowers in financial hardship are to be treated, and provides a framework \nfor BPFI members and MABS clients to communicate with each other about \ndebts. \n\n \n•   The Irish Banking Culture Board has developed a Common Commitment of \nCare for Bereaved Customers, 13  which provides details of dedicated resources \navailable from banks for their customers.

As noted above, firms should provide training to staff to \nhelp them identify and respond appropriately to such circumstances if they arise.  \n \n\nAppropriate Treatment of Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances – Recording of \nInformation \n\n2.3.13  \nConsumers  in vulnerable circumstances will not always be willing or able, without \ndiscomfort or difficulty, to communicate those circumstances to a firm. It is \nimportant that they are assisted in doing so, and that they do not have to \nunnecessarily explain their circumstances on multiple occasions. Staff should \nrecord relevant information on vulnerability in an appropriate way that is \naccessible by other staff who may need it in the context of the ongoing customer \nrelationship.      \n \n2.3.14  \nIn order to ensure that they support consumers in vulnerable circumstances, \nfirms should have processes and systems in place to appropriately record \nrelevant information. In determining whether recording of information is \n‘appropriate’ firms must ensure that they are compliant with applicable data \nprotection laws 17 . Processes and systems should reflect appropriate levels of \nconsent (taking account of individual circumstances) and ensure that information \nis up to date, not prejudicial and retained only for appropriate purposes and \nperiods.  \n \n\n                                                                 \n16  Please also see Regulation 4(1)(f), and Regulation 10 of the Standards for Business which set out the Code’s general \nobligations on firms in relation to financial abuse. \n17  Data Protection Commission (2019).

All \ncustomers could use this facility to inform firms of their circumstances as the \ncustomers see fit. Such a facility might help customers in vulnerable \ncircumstances to avoid difficult conversations that might otherwise prevent them \nfrom communicating to the firm at all.  \n \n2.3.16  \nThere may also be circumstances where the customer is not willing or able to \nprovide information about their circumstances and where it will not be possible \nor practicable to obtain consent to retain this information. In such scenarios, it \nmay still be appropriate to record relevant information where it is clear that it will \nassist the firm in securing the customer’s interests. \n \n\nTrusted Contact Person \n\n2.3.17  \nThe revised Code includes a requirement 18  for firms to facilitate customers, who \nare personal consumers and who wish to do so, to provide the name and contact \ninformation of a trusted contact. Any person so nominated is someone with whom \na firm may communicate where there may be difficulty in dealing with the \ncustomer, or where financial abuse, including fraud, is suspected. This \nrequirement does not require that a customer be identified or categorised in \nadvance by a firm as a consumer in vulnerable circumstances. Any customer who \nis a personal consumer may choose to nominate a Trusted Contact Person. \n \n2.3.18  \nStaff of a firm should be familiar with the opportunity for customers to nominate \na Trusted Contact Person. When dealing with customers, staff can advise \ncustomers, where they believe that this is appropriate, that the customer can \nnominate a Trusted Contact Person. \n \n2.3.19  \nPrior to the arrangement being put in place, firms should explain clearly to \ncustomers and to the proposed ‘trusted contact’ what the role of a Trusted \nContact Person is and the circumstances under which they may be contacted \nunder the arrangement. \n \n2.3.20  \nA Trusted Contact Person is not a legal representative of the consumer. The \nappointment of a Trusted Contact Person allows a firm, at the firm’s discretion, to \ncontact the Trusted Contact Person for the purposes of communicating with, or \nreceiving information about, the consumer.  \n\n                                                                 \n18  Consumer Protection Regulations, Regulation 36.

For example, a customer may have in \nplace a decision making assistance arrangement under the Assisted Decision-\nMaking (Capacity) Act, 2015.

In \ncircumstances where a firm is concerned that there is an abusive or coercive \nrelationship between the customer and the nominated Trusted Contact Person, \nthe firm should consider what steps they might be able to take to assist the \ncustomer.

We highlight below two developments in the broader EU and domestic \nconsumer protection framework and consider their interaction with the Code. \n\n3.1.  \nAssisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act \n\nRight of Consumers to Make their Own Decisions \n\n3.1.1  \nThe Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (ADMA) came into effect on \n26 April 2023. This legislation provides a framework to support decision-making \nto maximise a relevant person's capacity in order to help uphold their rights and \nsafeguard their autonomy 19 . It introduced three types of support arrangements \nfor people who currently, or may shortly, face challenges when making certain \ndecisions. It also provides for people who wish to plan ahead for a time in the \nfuture when they might lose capacity, by way of an advance healthcare directive, \nor enduring power of attorney. \n \n3.1.2  \nIt is important to distinguish between lack of capacity and situations where there \nmay be no concerns about a customer’s decision-making capacity but whose \ncircumstances may raise concerns about vulnerability.  \n \n3.1.3  \nWhere firms are concerned about the decision-making capacity of an individual, \nthe provisions of the ADMA must be complied with. Firms must consider the \nsupporting Codes of Practice issued by the Decision Support Service, 20  including \nthe Code of Practice for Financial Service Providers. 21  \n \n3.1.4  \nThe requirements and guidance under the Code relating to consumers in \nvulnerable circumstances are consistent with, and complement, the requirements \nunder the ADMA. Under both the ADMA and the Code, staff of financial services \nfirms must be able to assist consumers in vulnerable circumstances, with the \nADMA focusing on vulnerability linked to decision-making capacity. The \nprovisions of the Code respect an individual’s decision-making discretion and \nautonomy while seeking to ensure that consumers in vulnerable circumstances \n\n                                                                 \n19  Decision Support Service (2023).

Where a customer may require \nassistance to make a decision, firms will need to comply with the provisions of the \nADMA and the Code. \n \n3.1.5  \nThe obligation under the Code to secure the interests of consumers in vulnerable \ncircumstances requires firms to consider what reasonable steps might be taken to \nensure that those customers receive a full and proper service from the firm. This \nincludes customers who may be experiencing vulnerability due to diminished \ncapacity and customers who are experiencing vulnerability for other reasons. For \nexample, a customer who speaks another language and who does not have full \ncommand of English is not someone who lacks capacity. The customer is, \nhowever, vulnerable to making decisions that they do not understand or on which \nthey might be insufficiently informed. Firms should take reasonable steps in these \ncircumstances to assist such customers, recognising that customers in such \ncircumstances must also take responsibility for their own actions and decisions.  \n \n\n3.2.   European Accessibility Act \n\n3.2.1  \nThe European Accessibility Act, implemented in Ireland by the European Union \n(Accessibility Requirements of Products and Services) Regulations 2023 (S.I. No. \n636 of 2023) will come into effect in June 2025. This Act introduces new \nrequirements around accessibility of products and services, including financial \nproducts and services, in the EU. \n \n3.2.2  \nThe European Accessibility Act aims to improve standards across all sectors, \naligning with the expectations of the Code for financial services firms. Persons \nwith disabilities should not be regarded as inherently vulnerable. It is often the \ndisabling barriers in society, rather than the individual’s impairment that create \nthe vulnerability for that person. So, for example, the way in which information is \nprovided can make persons with a disability who are otherwise wholly competent \nand capable of conducting their own affairs, vulnerable to not having, or being \nable to access, the full information needed to inform their choices; or the \nnecessary technology to be able to conduct financial services might not be \ndesigned to take into account the needs of persons with disabilities. \n \n3.2.3  \nThe requirement of the Code to secure customers’ interests requires financial \nservices firms to take reasonable steps to ensure that their processes and ",
