Other more basic financial products or services might be targeted at all customers (e.g. bank accounts) in which case the average customer may have more limited knowledge and lower levels of financial literacy.

Considerations should include: •   Who is the firm communicating with – does the target market have specific needs or characteristics such as a lower level of digital or financial literacy? •   Are there cohorts of consumers in vulnerable circumstances, who may have specific information needs? For example, certain cohorts of consumers may have a language other than English as a first language, so consideration could be given to how to ensure that all communications and information about products and services are understandable for consumers in the target market and customer base. •   Do some customers have accessibility needs and can information be presented in ways that address these needs – for example, firms should consider if people using assistive technologies such as voice commands can navigate information. •   Consideration could be given to the use of Braille display, hearing induction loops, relay text audio explanations and access to Irish Sign Language (ISL) interpreters.

Firms are required to share the KID with consumers in advance of their final consent to purchase. The purpose of the KID is to provide investors with a simple, generic and concise document that provides key information on the investment product. Notwithstanding the prescriptive nature of the PRIIPs KID requirements, firms should still give consideration to how they can contribute to customer engagement with and understanding of the information provided in the KID. However, in practice we have seen examples of KIDs where it is clear that the firm has taken a ‘tick box’ approach to the provision of information via a KID with limited attempts to support navigability and understanding through the use of plain language, layout, font size and use of headings and colour or bold. The findings and learnings from the research on mortgage refinancing have direct relevance for all firms as they consider how to most effectively present information to their customers. They can be applied across many types of information and disclosures  provided by firms to their customers. Firms should have a continued focus on what steps they can take to improve the effectiveness of the information they provide to their customers. No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of. 22 Case Study 4 - informing effectively to drive action-taking by customers –Home Insurance Market The Central Bank carried out a review in 2022 that showed evidence of increasing levels of under-insurance in the home insurance market as a result of an increase in rebuild costs. 17  Under-insurance can cause significant consumer detriment, as if a property is underinsured it can result in customers not being fully covered for losses if they have to make a home insurance claim. The review found that not all firms were sufficiently highlighting key risks to consumers. A number of areas were identified where further action was needed by firms to make consumers aware of the risk and implications of under-insurance. The Central Bank outlined a range of steps that firms were required to undertake to communicate the risk of under-insurance to customers in a clear and understandable way by: •   Writing to all home insurance policyholders explaining under-insurance; •   Setting out the implications of being under-insured, the reasons why this is currently a heightened risk and how policyholders can better estimate the adequate insured value; •   Providing clear worked examples of the consequences of under-insurance in the event that a policyholder had to make a claim where their home was underinsured; and •   Treating the risk of under-insurance as ‘key information’ and disclosing it as such to customers. The impact of this communication was that customers were effectively informed about the risks and consequences of being under-insured and prompted to take appropriate actions to address this risk.   This example is set in a specific context and should over-insurance be identified, then we would expect firms to advise of the risk of over-insuring, whereby customers pay excess premiums based on cover that is not required. In this case study the Central Bank identified a gap in firms’ engagement with their customers on an important customer risk and instructed firms to engage effectively with their customers on this matter. We expect firms to proactively consider what information their customers need to support them in making informed decisions to protect their financial well-being. 23",
