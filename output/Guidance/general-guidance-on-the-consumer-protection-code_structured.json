In other cases \nthe context of the requirement will demand that the term ‘customer’ (or \n‘consumer’) will also include, where appropriate, potential customers and/or \nformer customers (that are not current customers). For example, assessments of \nsuitability of alternative arrangements for customers of a branch of a credit \ninstitution only applies in respect of existing customers.  \n\n1.3.4  \n‘Consumer’ is a subset of all customers and is defined in the Code as being limited \nto a specific class of customer that is: \n\na)   a natural person, \n\nb)   a group of natural persons, including a partnership, club, charity, trust or \nother unincorporated body, or \n\nc)   an incorporated body, that is not – \n\ni.  \nan incorporated body that had an annual turnover in excess of €5 \nmillion in the previous financial year, or \n\nii.  \nan incorporated body that is a member of a group of companies having a \ncombined turnover greater than €5 million in the previous financial \nyear. \n\n1.3.5  \nThe Standards for Business Regulations apply, for the most part, in respect of \nbusiness done with all customers as defined.

In some cases, the \nobligations of the Consumer Protection Regulations are further limited to \ncustomers who are personal consumers i.e. natural persons acting outside their \nbusiness, trade or profession. \n\n1.3.7  \nThe term ‘affected consumer’ is referred to in a number of requirements within the \nregulations.

As such, the Central Bank does not \nnecessarily expect that all customers of a firm must be notified of every change or \ndevelopment, but that where a change (e.g. to the terms of business, or to certain \nfees or charges) will affect certain consumers, then those consumers should be \nnotified in line with the relevant requirement. It is for a firm to determine in the \ncircumstances which of their consumers are affected.  \n\n1.3.8  \nA number of requirements require consideration of the term ‘average consumer’. \nThis appears several times in the regulations and, again, the term is not defined \nwithin the Code. This is because the meaning of ‘average consumer’ may differ \nfrom one firm to another, across a product or service line offered by that firm, or \nacross different financial services sectors. One product or service type offered by a \nfirm may be more likely to attract sophisticated investors, with higher levels of \nfinancial literacy. Other more basic financial products or services might be \ntargeted at all customers (e.g. bank accounts) in which case the average customer \nmay have more limited knowledge and lower levels of financial literacy. The \nconcept of ‘average consumer’ is particularly relevant in terms of firms considering \nwhether their communications are likely to be understood by the customers \nintended to receive the communication. \n\n1.3.9  \nReferences to variable interest rates throughout the Consumer Protection \nRegulations should be interpreted as including tracker interest rates. \n\n1.4.   Assessing Compliance  \n\n1.4.1  \nThis Guidance, Guidance on Securing Customers’ Interests, Protecting Consumers \nin Vulnerable Circumstances and the Central Bank’s Guide to Consumer \nProtection Risk Assessment (CPRA Guidance) 7 , which sets out the Central Bank’s \nexpectations of firms’ consumer risk management frameworks, are \ncomplementary documents, which should be read together. They have been \ndeveloped to support firms in implementing their Code requirements and risk \nmanagement frameworks. The CPRA Guidance describes the Central Bank’s \nexpectations of regulated financial services firms in implementing or enhancing \ntheir frameworks for managing risks to consumers, which should support firms in \nassessing the effectiveness of their frameworks.

Guidance on Securing \nCustomers’ Interests 9  articulates the Central Bank’s expectations of firms in \nmeeting their obligation under the Standards for Business to secure customers’ \ninterests.

This can help to address the asymmetry in knowledge and information \nbetween firms and customers. Considerations should include: \n\n•   Who is the firm communicating with – does the target market have specific \nneeds or characteristics such as a lower level of digital or financial literacy? \n\n•   Are there cohorts of consumers in vulnerable circumstances, who may \nhave specific information needs? For example, certain cohorts of \nconsumers may have a language other than English as a first language, so \nconsideration could be given to how to ensure that all communications and \ninformation about products and services are understandable for \nconsumers in the target market and customer base.  \n\n•   Do some customers have accessibility needs and can information be \npresented in ways that address these needs – for example, firms should \nconsider if people using assistive technologies such as voice commands can \nnavigate information.   \n\n•   Consideration could be given to the use of Braille display, hearing induction \nloops, relay text audio explanations and access to Irish Sign Language (ISL) \ninterpreters.   \n\nConsideration 2 – Content   \n2.2.6  \nContent should be drafted to meet the needs of customers and support their \nunderstanding taking into account their level of financial literacy and familiarity \nwith financial concepts.

The review found that not all \nfirms were sufficiently highlighting key risks to consumers.  \n \nA number of areas were identified where further action was needed by firms to \nmake consumers aware of the risk and implications of under-insurance. The Central \nBank outlined a range of steps that firms were required to undertake to \ncommunicate the risk of under-insurance to customers in a clear and \nunderstandable way by:  \n  \n\n•   Writing to all home insurance policyholders explaining under-insurance; \n\n•   Setting out the implications of being under-insured, the reasons why this is \n\ncurrently a heightened risk and how policyholders can better estimate the \n\nadequate insured value; \n\n•   Providing clear worked examples of the consequences of under-insurance in \n\nthe event that a policyholder had to make a claim where their home was \n\nunderinsured; and \n\n•   Treating the risk of under-insurance as ‘key information’ and disclosing it as \n\nsuch to customers. \n\n   \nThe impact of this communication was that customers were effectively informed \nabout the risks and consequences of being under-insured and prompted to take \nappropriate actions to address this risk.   This example is set in a specific context and \nshould over-insurance be identified, then we would expect firms to advise of the \nrisk of over-insuring, whereby customers pay excess premiums based on cover that \nis not required.  \n \nIn this case study the Central Bank identified a gap in firms’ engagement with \ntheir customers on an important customer risk and instructed firms to engage \neffectively with their customers on this matter.

These complex high-risk investment activities present a significant risk \nof misunderstanding or confusion for consumers as some of their features are \nsimilar to regulated investment products. In terms of the potential impact of \ncustomer misunderstanding or confusion - a consumer of such an unregulated \nproduct might incorrectly assume, for example, that they are entitled to statutory \nlevels of compensation available to ‘eligible clients’ in the event that the firm is \nunable to return money or investment instruments it owes to consumers who \ninvested with it. In such cases, the risk that consumers will misunderstand the \nregulatory status of the unregulated product or service is very high, and it could be \nchallenging to effectively mitigate the associated risks. \n\n2.3.6  \nHowever, there may be cases where it will be possible for the risks associated with \nthe provision of unregulated activities of regulated firms to be mitigated by firms. \nThis will most likely occur where the risk of misunderstanding and the potential for \nharm or loss to the consumer is low.

These requirements apply to the regulated business of \nfirms conducted with customers who meet the definition of ‘consumer’ i.e. \nindividuals and small businesses. \n\n3.2.

Within that context, the \nCode includes a number of requirements in relation to customers’ sustainability \npreferences.  \n\n3.3.2  \nSustainability preferences with regard to a financial service are required to be \ngathered, where relevant. The statement of suitability is required to identify where \na financial product or service meets any sustainability preferences gathered from \nthe consumer.

These \ninclude requirements for firms to ensure such platforms are designed to be easy to \nuse and navigate with appropriate supports provided, that the technology is \ntested, and that they produce consistent and objective outcomes for consumers.  \n\n3.5.5  \nFirms using digital platforms, and other digital means of communication and \nengagement, must also ensure that they comply with all relevant Code standards \nand requirements.

To help ensure that the consumer is making an informed \n\ndecision, the BNPL provider should provide concise clearly visible information to the \nconsumer at the point of decision highlighting that the consumer is entering into a credit \nagreement, for example, displaying details on charges and fees, and what the \nconsequences are for the consumer in the event of default on subsequent payments.  \n\nBased on research conducted by the Central Bank, presenting concise salient disclosures \nabout the key risks of using BNPL within the payment checkout (i.e. made very visible at \nthe point of decision making), improves consumers’ ability to make informed choices about \nusing BNPL. This research demonstrated that these effects are significant for a nationally \nrepresentative sample of consumers, including consumers who are potentially in \nvulnerable circumstances. \n\n                                                                 \n32  Central Bank of Ireland (2023).

For example, a firm pays a finfluencer to post promoting \ntheir firm’s service or product. The finfluencer’s post in effect encourages \nfollowers to use the firm’s products or services.
