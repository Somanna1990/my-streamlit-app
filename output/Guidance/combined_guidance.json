For example, certain cohorts of consumers may have a language other than English as a first language, so consideration could be given to how to ensure that all communications and information about products and services are understandable for consumers in the target market and customer base. •   Do some customers have accessibility needs and can information be presented in ways that address these needs – for example, firms should consider if people using assistive technologies such as voice commands can navigate information. •   Consideration could be given to the use of Braille display, hearing induction loops, relay text audio explanations and access to Irish Sign Language (ISL) interpreters.

Firms are required to share the KID with consumers in advance of their final consent to purchase. The purpose of the KID is to provide investors with a simple, generic and concise document that provides key information on the investment product. Notwithstanding the prescriptive nature of the PRIIPs KID requirements, firms should still give consideration to how they can contribute to customer engagement with and understanding of the information provided in the KID. However, in practice we have seen examples of KIDs where it is clear that the firm has taken a ‘tick box’ approach to the provision of information via a KID with limited attempts to support navigability and understanding through the use of plain language, layout, font size and use of headings and colour or bold. The findings and learnings from the research on mortgage refinancing have direct relevance for all firms as they consider how to most effectively present information to their customers. They can be applied across many types of information and disclosures  provided by firms to their customers. Firms should have a continued focus on what steps they can take to improve the effectiveness of the information they provide to their customers. No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of. 22 Case Study 4 - informing effectively to drive action-taking by customers –Home Insurance Market The Central Bank carried out a review in 2022 that showed evidence of increasing levels of under-insurance in the home insurance market as a result of an increase in rebuild costs. 17  Under-insurance can cause significant consumer detriment, as if a property is underinsured it can result in customers not being fully covered for losses if they have to make a home insurance claim. The review found that not all firms were sufficiently highlighting key risks to consumers. A number of areas were identified where further action was needed by firms to make consumers aware of the risk and implications of under-insurance. The Central Bank outlined a range of steps that firms were required to undertake to communicate the risk of under-insurance to customers in a clear and understandable way by: •   Writing to all home insurance policyholders explaining under-insurance; •   Setting out the implications of being under-insured, the reasons why this is currently a heightened risk and how policyholders can better estimate the adequate insured value; •   Providing clear worked examples of the consequences of under-insurance in the event that a policyholder had to make a claim where their home was underinsured; and •   Treating the risk of under-insurance as ‘key information’ and disclosing it as such to customers. The impact of this communication was that customers were effectively informed about the risks and consequences of being under-insured and prompted to take appropriate actions to address this risk.   This example is set in a specific context and should over-insurance be identified, then we would expect firms to advise of the risk of over-insuring, whereby customers pay excess premiums based on cover that is not required. In this case study the Central Bank identified a gap in firms’ engagement with their customers on an important customer risk and instructed firms to engage effectively with their customers on this matter. We expect firms to proactively consider what information their customers need to support them in making informed decisions to protect their financial well-being. 23",

    "Regulation Text": "Firms should navigate innovation and change in a manner that incorporates securing customers’ interests into their commercial decision-making process and seeks to avoid creating risks to customers. The decision to materially change a firm’s product or service offering or their mode of delivery, should include a full consideration of the impact on and outcomes for customers. 12 Digital for Good: Ireland’s Digital Inclusion Roadmap explores some of these issues. Example 1: Securing Customers’ Interests in Digital Delivery Customers’ interests need to be considered and appropriately secured in the transition to digital delivery of products and services. There is a clear trend in financial services towards reduced physical presence and a reduction of in-person services with increasing delivery of products and services through digital channels. In moving to digital delivery, firms must secure their customers' interests. It is not sufficient to simply digitalise and rationalise activity in the absence of consideration of customer impacts. We expect firms’ digital platforms to be designed with their customers’ interests in mind. Firms are required to ensure that digital platforms are easy to navigate, to use and to understand, ensuring that consumers do not need specialist knowledge to access them. It is important in particular to ensure that certain cohorts of consumers, including those with poor digital literacy, do not become excluded through poor design. Firms should give consideration to the suitability of alternative modes of service provision for existing customers who may be excluded by digital delivery. This should include the development of solutions to ensure that customers, especially at-risk customers, can avail of services. A firm should only proceed with a decision to move to digital delivery, where it is satisfied that it has carefully considered customer impacts and identified appropriate mitigants to address identified issues for customers. This should include careful consideration of the impact on customers in vulnerable circumstances and what reasonable assistance might be provided to mitigate adverse impacts. Customers should also be provided with appropriate notice of changes to services, and impact assessments should be undertaken after transition to address any significant issues that may arise from a consumer perspective. This approach is reflected in requirements for retail banks relating to branch closure, or significant amendment of branch services, set out in the Banking, Credit and Arrears part of the Consumer Protection Regulations. Securing customers’ interests requires  all firms to consider customer impacts when taking decisions to move to digital delivery. Commercial decisions should not be considered in isolation from a consideration of the impacts of that decision on customers. The decision to change a product, service or delivery channel should only be taken following full consideration of the risks and customer impacts that the changes pose. Firms need to be able to demonstrate how they are securing customers’ interests in undertaking such significant business model changes. Example 1: Securing Customers’ Interests in the Transition to Digital Delivery -  Customers’ interests need to be considered and appropriately secured in the transition to digital delivery.",

    "Regulation Sub Section Number": "2.3.2",
    "Regulation Text": "When a firm is designing or reviewing a product, considering pricing or developing its communications and customer service approach, it should consider the needs of its customer base and target market. Firms should design and bring to market products with features that meet the needs of consumers identified for the product. Example 2: Securing Customers Interests’ under Digital Delivery Some firms only engage with their customers through digital channels. It is important that these firms give careful consideration to how they can secure their customers’ interests through this delivery channel. Carefully designed interfaces which are designed with the needs of the target market in mind are a key way that firms can secure their customers’ interests. Firms will often focus on ease of access, navigability and execution where they are seeking to encourage customers and potential customers to purchase their products and services.  It is clearly in the interests of firms to focus on good design where it supports growth of their customer base. Importantly, these principles should equally apply where firms are designing interfaces and systems to provide support for their customers. While customers may generally only need to engage with a firm through its standard digital interfaces to access services and execute transactions, there will be times where customers need access to additional support. For example if a system or interface is not working for a customer they will need to be able to engage with the firm to access support to resolve their issue. Similarly where a customer suspects that they have been the victim of fraud they will also need to be able to engage with the firm to access appropriate supports to deal with the situation. Supports and access channels should be designed in a way that seeks to effectively support the customer to get issues resolved quickly and to minimise negative impacts for customers. For example where a customer suspects that they have been the victim of fraud, having rapid access to appropriate supports can help customers to take steps to stop the harm and reduce negative impacts. Accessing and navigating supports should be simple and intuitive. Multiple types of supports can play a role, including providing access to standardised information, chatbots, helplines etc. The supports available should reflect the issue they are designed to address and the likely needs of customers impacted by that issue. Looking at the fraud example again, what does a customer who suspects they are the victim of fraud need? They need to be able to notify the firm quickly and have confidence that this will be acted on straightaway. This is vital to stopping harm and minimising impacts on the customer. Firms need to consider the circumstances of the customer and the impact this can have on the ability to navigate systems and processes. Reflecting this, systems to access supports need to be easy to find, access and use. Consideration should be given to whether in certain circumstances customers should have access to in-person support for significant issues. Supports for online or digital customers are an important aspect of meeting the obligation to secure customers’ interests. They should reflect the issue they are designed to address, and need to be easy to find, access and use. Example 2: Use of Incentives in Product Design Incentives should be designed in a way that delivers positive outcomes for customers. They should not impair a customer’s ability to act in their own interests and to make informed choices in line with their financial needs. Firms often include incentives in product offerings to create differentiation from competitors’ products and to make them more attractive for customers or potential customers based on customer preferences. While such features may represent legitimate commercial practices, the rationale for the inclusion of such features should be explored to determine if a firm is securing its customers’ interests. In assessing the appropriateness of including incentives in product design, firms need to ensure that the inclusion of incentives aligns with the interests of customers. Incentives should be designed in a way that supports customers to act in their own interests and make appropriately informed decisions in terms of product choices. Firms must not include features in products which unfairly exploit or take advantage of customer behaviours, habits, preferences or biases in order to benefit the firm in a way that will result in customer detriment. The obligation to not exploit customer behaviours, habits, preferences or biases is explored further in section 2.4 below. It is also important that customers understand the implications of choosing a product with an incentive instead of other alternatives available in the market that may potentially be more suitable for the customer over the long-term. Including features that increase the initial attractiveness of products, can interfere with price transparency and the ability of consumers to compare products effectively. Mortgage cashback provides one such example. Where it can be demonstrated that the cashback incentive can provide a positive outcome for the customer this may represent a legitimate commercial practice. However, if the provisions of such an incentive solely seeks to exploit customer inertia by incentivising a customer to choose a product which will be a more expensive product for them over the life of the product, this does not align with the obligation to secure customers’ interests. Firms should ensure that when offering incentives, they are designed in a way that seeks to deliver positive outcomes for customers by supporting customers to act in their own interests and to make informed choices in line with their financial needs. Overall, firms should be able to demonstrate how the features of a product, including incentives, align with the interests of customers. Example 3: Use of Incentives in Product Design Incentives should be designed in a way that delivers positive outcomes for customers. They should not impair a customer’s ability to act in their own interests and to make informed choices in line with their financial needs.",

    "Regulation Text": "The asymmetry or imbalance in information, expertise and time between financial services firms and customers can increase the risk that customers may experience poor outcomes where firms are not securing their customers’ interests. In designing products, services and delivery channels, firms should not be seeking to take advantage of these asymmetries. Firms can only design and bring to market products with features, charges and risks that meet the needs of customers identified for the product, i.e. products must be suitable for the customers they are targeted at. Product complexity can impact the ability of customers to understand risks associated with products and to compare products effectively. Firms need to consider difficulties customers may have in understanding the features of products. Given this, for more complex products or services, firms should consider their potential target market in particular detail. They need to take account of any increased risk of consumer harm associated with customers accessing inappropriate products or services, due to a lack of customer understanding of the risks involved. For example, investment products with complicated features may make it difficult for retail investors to fully understand the potential risks associated with the product and the probability of those risks arising. Such products may only be appropriate for a narrower target market and a particular distribution strategy or channel. Some products may not be appropriate for execution only models and should only be sold with advice where it is possible for the firm to determine the suitability of the product for the customer and the level of customer understanding. Firms should carefully consider how specific products are targeted and whether they should only be or typically be sold with advice. In meeting their obligation to secure their customers’ interests, firms need to be able to demonstrate that they can effectively bridge the gap between the knowledge and expertise of their target market, and the complexity and sophistication of a product.

Example 4: Marketing and Sale of ‘Green’/‘Sustainable’ Products Customers should have confidence that ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’ financial products are accurately and fairly represented. Firms need to engage with climate-related activities as responsible agents in the transition to a climate neutral economy. Consumers of financial services increasingly want access to ’green’ or ‘sustainable’ financial products to support climate transition. There has been a substantial increase in the development of financial products described as being ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’. It is important for industry to ensure that sustainable financial products are described in an accurate and transparent manner and that customers can trust the information they receive regarding the green credentials of firms and products. The provision of information on ‘sustainable’ or ‘green’ financial products must be rooted in both the obligation on firms to inform effectively and to secure customers’ interests.

However securing the interests of customers cannot justify the unfair exploitation of a cohort of customers given their individual characteristics, resulting in their detriment. The interests of all customers must be secured. Where firms unfairly exploit one cohort of customers, they cannot argue that securing the interests of another cohort of customers justifies their actions. 2.7 Unregulated Activities of Regulated Firms",

    "Regulation Text": "Where regulated firms undertake both regulated and unregulated activities, there is a heightened risk that consumers may misunderstand the protections they are afforded when accessing unregulated products and/or services by virtue of the regulated status of the firm. Regulated firms often use branding and other marketing tools to distinguish themselves from other firms operating in the market. A firm will utilise branding to identify its products and services as having come from that firm. Where a customer engages with a regulated firm to transact business activities that are not regulated, the firm’s reputation and its regulatory status (i.e. the ‘Halo Effect’), may serve to provide unjustified reassurance to customers. For example, this may lead customers to believe that the sale of the unregulated products or services are subject to the same binding regulatory requirements as apply to the sale of regulated products, when they are not. Moreover, customers may assume that they have access to protections such as deposit protection or investor compensation schemes, when they do not. This is an area with the potential risk for very significant detriment to consumers. Confusion can arise where regulated firms, or their unregulated subsidiaries, carry out unregulated activities while using identical or similar branding to the branding used for the regulated activities also provided by the regulated firm. Regulated firms have a positive obligation under the Code to take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk that a customer will understand an activity to be, or to carry the protections of, a regulated activity where this is not the case. This requires firms to ensure that the use of branding does not contribute to confusion or misunderstanding on the regulatory status of a product or service. The closer in nature an unregulated product or service is, or appears to be, to a regulated financial service or product, the greater the risk of such misunderstanding or misperception. Firms need to carefully consider the use of branding on their websites and apps where these channels are used to display information and or facilitate execution of transactions in products or services that are not regulated. 20  It should be clear to customers when they are moving outside the regulatory space. This can be supported through disclosures and warnings but firms also need to consider if the use of branding can contribute to confusion . 20 Regulation 72 of the Consumer Protection Regulations requires firms to provide information on its website in relation to regulated activities on a separate webpage from any webpage on its website providing information on unregulated activities. Example 6: Appropriate Use of Firm Branding In utilising branding, firms need to carefully consider the potential impacts and outcomes for customers. It is not appropriate for firms to use branding in a way that can confuse or mislead customers or potential customers on the regulatory status of products or services.",

    "Regulation Text": "It is therefore important for firms to ensure that customers understand the regulatory status of the products and services they are provided with. There should be no risk that a customer will have a sense that they are in ‘regulated territory’ when they purchase unregulated products or services from a regulated provider. Under the Code’s Standards for Business, firms are required to ensure that all information they provide to customers is presented in a way that seeks to effectively inform the customer. Under the Securing Customers’ Interests Supporting Standards for Business, firms are required to take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk that a customer will understand an activity to be, or to carry the protections of, a regulated activity where this is not the case. Firms’ use of branding should not contribute to confusion on the regulatory status of products and services. The creation by a financial services group of a separate subsidiary for the purpose of undertaking unregulated activities, using the same branding it uses for its regulated activities, where those unregulated activities have significant potential to cause confusion for consumers and carry high risk of potential harm would not reflect a culture or mind-set that seeks to secure the interests of those consumers.",

    "Regulation Text": "A firm is required to ensure that all information it provides to customers is presented in a way that seeks to effectively inform the customer – this includes bringing key information to the customer’s attention, and ensuring that all information that it provides to a customer is clear, accurate, up to date and written in plain and accessible language. This obligation extends to all aspects of the relationship with the customer, including how the firm ensures that the customer is clear on the contracts that they may enter into with the firm. Case Study 2: Business Interruption Insurance The Central Bank expects firms to adopt a customer-first approach to the resolution of contractual ambiguities. Where ambiguities arise, the interpretation most favourable to the policyholder should prevail. At the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic the Central Bank immediately identified business interruption as a significant issue that would impact businesses across Ireland. The issue of whether or not Business Interruption (BI) insurance policies provided cover for the losses arising from the Government’s imposed closures became a central issue both in Ireland and internationally. We moved swiftly to identify potentially systemic issues of customer harm relating to BI insurance and prioritised this issue though a system-wide supervisory examination underpinned by the COVID-19 and Business Interruption Insurance Supervisory Framework (Supervisory Framework). 21 We were clear in our expectations and requirements of regulated firms, by requiring that all valid claims be paid promptly and where there was a doubt about the meaning of a term in a firm’s BI insurance policy wordings, the interpretation most favourable to the policyholder should prevail. The Central Bank’s system-wide examination was based on identifying all groups of impacted policies where, in our view, the relevant contractual provisions provided cover for COVID-19 related interruption and/or interference to businesses. The Central Bank was clear with all relevant firms about its expectations and its view in relation to ‘cover’ and ‘causation’ following our review of relevant policy wordings. Some firms accepted valid claims early in the process while other firms decided to seek legal confirmation and clarification, based on the outcome of relevant test cases, before making a final determination on ‘cover’ and ‘causation’. However, following the decision of the High Court in February 2021 22 , all relevant firms accepted that cover existed for similarly affected policies and those firms then contacted policyholders with valid claims in order to progress those claims. The Central Bank also reinforced its expectations to relevant firms in respect of policy wordings that were determined to be responsive to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland. 21 https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/consumer-hub-library/covid-19/covid-19---business-interruption- insurance---supervisory-framework.pdf. 22 https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/8bfaa5dd-3ea3-4580-979f-0dfb2d8243be/2021_IEHC_78.pdf/pdf#view=fitH. This included an expectation that firms identify and contact potentially affected policyholders, assist policyholders in making a claim, were operationally ready to deal with claims and had adequate governance and oversight of the process. All relevant firms made progress in line with the Central Bank’s expectations, with relevant policyholders notified and settlements progressed where all required information had been provided by the policyholders.",
